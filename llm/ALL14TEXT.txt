Say: Welcome to the class. Today, we will be covering the session ‚ÄúConcierge Services‚Äù. We have learnt in the last session that concierge is a sub department in front office. Today we will understand the detailed attributes of the department.
A concierge is a department that works in Front office but is separate from Front desk activities for fulfilling guest services.
Its like having the services of a personal assistant whenever the guest needs them.
They are fast, flawless, confident and reliable.. Like a clockwork, they do not deviate from the standards.
A good hotel concierge has impressive powers and can assist with almost any travel problem the guest might face, like magic!!

A very long journey

Arrrrrgghhh

üìù Notes:
Say:
I want you all to imagine a situation like you are a guest who is to reach a great five star hotel.
Pause to get attention of the learners.

Narrate the situation in a medium pace. 
It's been a long journey getting to your destination. While you were putting the suitcase in the car at the airport, the wheel of the suit case broke, so you could not pull the suitcase, instead had to drag it!! You're sleepy and craving a hot shower as you carry your suitcases into the hotel lobby.
How would you feel?
Engage in discussion for few minutes.

Continue to say,
(Click) Heading for the front desk, you're distressed to see that there's a long line for check in. Just then, another official appears and gestures you over with a warm smile. He is wearing a typical uniform that is crisp and shows confidence. He offers you help to assist with your luggage.
What do you feel now?
Elicit answers from the learners.

Continue to say, 
(Click) This uniformed official or associate is concierge. The front desk staff are often the first to interact with guests, so it's important that they make a good impression. The concierge doesn't necessarily work with all guests, only those who seek their services. But for those who do, how well the concierge helps them is often the most lasting impression the guest have of their stay.

Concierge History and Origin

Ferdinand Gillet, founder, Les Clefs D'Or

KEEPER OF THE KEYS

üìù Notes:
Say:
Let us see how the concierge originated. (Click)
The roots of the title, "concierge" are from the Latin word¬†conserves, meaning "fellow slave." The word itself is French, meaning "keeper of the keys." During the Middle Ages, concierges did just that. When castles across Europe hosted visiting nobility and kings of other countries, the concierge kept the keys to the castle rooms, and ensured that guests had everything they needed during their stay. By the 1800s, a number of buildings in Europe, from government offices to prisons, had their own concierge on staff. In the 20th¬†century, the introduction of steamships and steam trains helped launch the modern travel industry. Guests from distant locales relied on hotel employees for tour assistance and other services during their stays. Hotels throughout Europe began creating concierge positions to take care of their guests. Additionally, apartment buildings in France traditionally featured a live-in employee with the title¬†concierge¬†or¬†portier¬†who acted as a sort of building manager.
Fancy visitors to the continent‚Äôs notable cities would need help getting oriented and making the right local connections, and so the position of hotel¬†portier¬†(later,¬†concierge)‚Äîa kind of multilingual, all-purpose personal secretary‚Äîwas developed. The Swiss achieved particular renown for their work in this area, and they eventually brought their practices to France and other neighboring countries. Hence, the first modern concierge (or set of them) was likely of Swiss origin.

The concierge profession experienced a leap toward formalization in 1929 when Pierre Quentin, a concierge at the Hotel Ambassador, organized a meeting of a handful of fellow concierges in Paris to network and discuss best practices. The meeting was so productive that a professional society,¬†Union Professionnelle des Concierges des Grands Hotels, was formed among primarily French colleagues to aid in resource and knowledge sharing. This organization persisted through World War II. (Click) In 1929, Ferdinand Gillet, himself of Swiss origin, head concierge at the Hotel Scribe in Paris, founded Les Clefs D'Or.
He went on to be the first president of a pan-European professional society of concierges, founded at a ‚Äúcongress‚Äù in Cannes in 1952. The organization went international in 1970, taking the name¬†Union Internationale des Concierges d‚ÄôH√¥tels. Also known as¬†Les Clefs d‚ÄôOr¬†(‚ÄúThe Golden Keys‚Äù), the organization now comprises 44 member countries, with more than 3000 members.

It wasn't until the 1970s that the concierge position emerged in the United States, although hotel bell captains and front desk staff had unofficially been performing the same duties for many years. Thomas Wolfe is known as one of the first American concierges. He worked in Europe for several years before taking up a position with the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco in 1974.

The hotel concierge business has also changed in another way. Not all hotel concierges today are the real things. They may wear the concierge uniform and provide the same services, but many are actually contract employees of hospitality companies and ticket brokers. Outsourcing saves hotels on benefits, and some hotel industry insiders say it helps lower-tier (two- and three-star) hotels provide a service they couldn't otherwise afford.¬†
Technology has impacted the concierge business, just as it has virtually every other industry.¬†In some hotels, touch-screen kiosks have supplemented or even replaced concierge. These kiosks provide information on restaurants, shopping, city tours, and services. Guests can use them to print out maps, coupons, and tickets without ever interacting with a human being.

Difference Between aFront Desk and Concierge

Front Desk

Registration
Assign rooms to guests
Give room key
Convey any important information

Concierge

Is more about helping the guest enjoy 
Recommend places to visit
Make last minute reservations for the guest
Procure tickets to special events.
Personalized services.

‚Äπ#‚Ä∫

üìù Notes:
Ask:
It seems that both front desk associate and concierge team handle guest services. Then why do we need two different departments?
Can anyone make a guess how these two departments ‚Äì Front desk and Concierge different than each other?
Engage in discussion for 15 minutes.

Say:
Front desk staff greet guests when they arrive and check them in according to their reservation. They assign rooms to guests, give them room keys, and explain how to get to their rooms. They also convey any important information, such as what time breakfast is served. If the guests have any questions, such as the hours or location of the gym, it's the front desk clerk's job to know the answers. Once in their rooms, the guest may call the front desk with a question or to set up a wake-up call. In most hotels, the front desk is staffed around the clock, so if the guest wants to know at 3 a.m. at what time the restaurant opens, they can call the front desk, and the night shift associate will be happy to give required information to the guest.

(Click) The concierge's job is more about helping the guest enjoy the area they are visiting. If a guest wants to know which restaurants are nearby, the front desk often has menus or brochure the guest can look at. But if a guest wants a recommendation for an elegant, out-of-the-way spot or a cozy pub, they contact the concierge. Concierge can also make reservations for the guest, even in the last minute. They are also the one who can procure tickets to the ballet, cabaret show or circus, and advise the guest on the best seats to choose. As I said before, they are like personal assistants, who give more personalized services.

Uniformed Services

Pride, Confidence And Loyalty

Lasting Impression

Bell attendants 
Door attendants 
Valet parking attendants 
Transportation personnel 
Concierges

üìù Notes:
Say:
Concierge team is also called as Uniform services. 
Can anyone guess why? Don‚Äôt other departments wear uniforms?
Elicit response from the learners.

They are the sub department who wear a specific uniform that is similar or standard through out the hotel industry. It is a group of people in the employ of a state or an organisation that wear a typical uniform,  like the country's armed services or the police. Similarly the concierge also carries the same standard of pride, confidence and loyalty in their uniforms in the hotel.

Uniformed Services in Hotels 
Employees who work in the uniformed service department of the hotel generally provide the most personalized guest service. Taken into consideration the degree of attention given to the guests by this department. While personal in reservations, front desk, and communications areas affect guest perceptions, it is often personal in uniformed service who make a lasting impression. The uniformed staff consists of bell hops and concierge associates. In big hotels these two can be different departments. In many hotels the duties and responsibilities are shared and overlapped between the two departments.

The primary positions within the uniformed service department are:
Bell attendants - Persons who provide baggage services between servicing the lobby area and the guest room.
Door attendants - Persons who provide baggage service and traffic control at the hotel entrance.
Valet Parking attendants - Persons who provide parking service for guests automobiles.
Transportation personnel - person who provide transportation services for guests, such as parking.
Concierges - Person who assist guests by making restaurant reservations, arranging for transportation, getting tickets for theater, sporting, arrange local or regional newspaper etc.

üìù Notes:
Say:

Bell Attendants :
Many Guests arrive at the hotel with heavy baggage or several pieces of luggage. Guest receive help handling this luggage from probably the best known employee among¬†the uniformed service staff: the bell attendant.
The selection of the bell attendant¬†has to be done carefully, because most hotels have carts or baggage trolley¬†for transporting baggage, the physical ability to actually carry the baggage is not a critical job qualification. More importantly the bell desk personals should have strong communication skills and should be able to give personalized service to each guest.
Below are some tasks performed by the bell desk attendants, even though the mentioned tasks appear simple they all require a degree of professionalism.
Transport guest luggage to and from guest rooms.
Familiarize guests with the hotel‚Äôs facilities and services, safety features, as well as the guest room and in room amenities .

Door Attendants :
Door attendants play a role similar to bell attendants, they are dedicated to welcoming the guest to the hotel. 
A skilled and experienced door attendant learns the names of frequent guests. When these guests return to the hotel, the door attendant is able to greet them by name and can introduce them to other front office staff. Such personal service enhances the reputation of the hotel and provides the guest with a unique experience.¬†
Some of the duties on the door attendants are :-
Opening hotel doors and assisting guests upon arrival.

üìù Notes:
Say:

Valet Parking attendants :
Valet Parking is generally available at hotels offering world-class, Luxury or 5 Star service. Specially trained employees should park guest and visitors cars. The personal attention and security of valet parking service is considered both a luxury and a convenience.
Guest do not have to worry about finding a parking space, walking to the hotel in bad weather, or finding their vehicles in the parking lot. Valet parking attendants are also responsible for the security of ¬†vehicles being moved to and from the hotel entrance. Attendants should not take a car into their care without issuing a receipt to the guest. Usually in the form of a ticket.¬†
Vehicles keys must be kept in a secure area, and only issued by qualified personal. Cars should be only returned to the guests when they return the receipt or ticket issued by the attendant before they can receive their keys. If a Key is lost or given to the wrong person, the vehicle can be rendered inoperable or considered stolen and the hotel may be held financially responsible for the same.

Transportation personal :
Transportation ¬†personal or Divers must be well trained and properly licensed to operate the vehicle. They usually meet at the airport pick up point.
Since these drivers are sometimes the first contact the guest will have with the hotel, it is important for them to be polite, efficient, and knowledgeable about the property. Drivers should also offer according to the weather hot /cold towels and packaged drinking water to the guest. It is generally customary for drivers to provide some information about the hotel while in transit.
Drivers should also help guests entering and exiting the vehicle. An experienced¬†drivers efficiently and carefully loads guest luggage into the vehicle. Drivers should also inform the hotel before the guests reaches the hotel. This allows¬†¬†the hotels to prepare and keep ready the check in procedures before the guest arrival at the hotel, especially in the case of a VIP.

Concierges :
In the distant past the concierge was the castle doorkeeper. A concierge's job was to ensure that all castle occupants were secure in their rooms at night. Travelling¬†royalty often were accompanied by a concierge who provides security, finalize food and lodging arrangements etc. As hotels became more common in Europe, the concierge eventually became part of the staff that provides personalized guest services. 

Concierge¬†may be easily identified by the prominent gold crossed keys displayed on their jacket lapel. To earn these keys, a concierge must be certified by the international association of concierges, known as Les Clefs d'Or¬†( Golden Keys).
Concierge may provide custom services to hotel guests. Duties include making reservations for dining; securing tickets for theatre and sporting events; arranging for transportation; and providing information on cultural events and local attractions.

Where to find Concierge Desk?

Is not located at the front desk. 
On cruise ships, the concierge may even be on a different deck. 
As the guest take a chair in front of the concierge desk, they receive special attention from an expert, who will take the time to help make the guest‚Äôs stay enjoyable and memorable.

[[OCR Image Text: CONCIERGE]]

üìù Notes:
Say: 
Front desk staff is, naturally, at the front desk, which is in the hotel lobby. It's positioned so that it is easy to see from a distance, either straight ahead as you come in the main entrance, or off to either side. Although it's called the front desk, it's really more of a raised counter than a desk, and it's longer than a desk, so that it may accommodate several associates who are helping several guests at the same time.

On the other hand, the concierge is not located at the front desk, and may or may not even be near the front desk. Sometimes, one will need to ask the front desk where to find the concierge. On cruise ships, the concierge may even be on a different deck. In many instances, though, the concierge sits at an actual desk, rather than at the counter. As the guest take a chair in front of the concierge desk, they know that they are receiving special attention from an expert, who will take the time to help make the guest‚Äôs stay enjoyable and memorable.

[[OCR Image Text: VEG]]

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Use this section to share a case study.
Read out the story in a medium pace so that all learners understand.
Offer to repeat or summarize the story if required. 
¬†
Say: I will tell you a real incidence now....Mrs. Jain checked in at the hotel. As she was tired because of her long journey, she called up the front desk & ordered a Cheese Sandwich. The room service attendant Mohan served the guest in her room. Looking at the burger she got super angry. 
Do you know why? Because the room service attendant had served a cheeseburger which is actually a hamburger topped with cheese. As Mrs. Jain was a vegetarian, she got deeply hurt & annoyed. She started shouting thinking that what if she would have eaten that cheese burger! She complained about this to Mohan. 
He simply said its ok I will get another one. 
This angered her even further and she called the manager. 
Manager apologized to Mrs. Jain personally & gave instructions to all staff member to take extra care of Mrs. Jain while serving the food in her room.
¬†
Ask: What made Mrs. Jain so angry? How the situation could have been avoided? How should Mohan respond in this situation?
¬†
Note: Have a small discussion with the learners.
Say:
The situation could have been avoided with clear conversation. The front desk associate should have confirmed the order once again with her and then should have placed the correct order with room service. If the front office associate was not sure of the order, he should have transferred the call directly to the room service operator.
 His mistake infuriated the guest and caused inconvenience to her. Then instead of apologizing to her in a proper manner, he replied very casually. It is very important to use the correct phrases while dealing with an angry guest. 
¬†
Transition: 
This was an interesting case study, isn‚Äôt it? This highlights the importance of the clear communication for a front office associate. Now we will discuss how to use the correct phases in different situations.

Watch this funny hotel management class in which hotel manager gets angry at the kind of responses he gets from his students.

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Use this section to share a case study. Paste this link onto Google or YouTube page.
Let the learners watch this movie clip to understand the scenario in the hotel. This clip is in Hindi but the discussion for the same should happen in English. 
Ask the learners for their views. Acknowledge the same and then move to importance of using correct phrases in 5 star hotels.
Offer to repeat or summarise the story if required. 
¬†
¬†Ask: What do you think, proper language should be used only when guests are around or all the time when you are on your job? 
Elicit answers from the learners.

¬†Say: Lets watch a small clip of a very funny movie and see what happens there. (Start the movie clip).

Say: That was so funny!! Now I want 2 volunteers to enact the same scene.. But in a professional manner.

Note: Choose 2 learners to react the same situation but using polite and English sentences. One student to be the guest the other to be the guest. For menu suggestions they can say any simple dish name like tea, coffee, biscuits, sandwich, milkshake, burger etc.

Debrief: 
This clip was more of a restaurant setup but such incidents do happen in Front desk also.  As a guest service associate  you must always be careful about the language you are using. If the guest is comfortable in local language such as Hindi in this case, then we can speak in Hindi. A front office associate is expected to be well behaved and polite. Use of abusive language gives a very bad impression to the guest not only about the person but about the hotel as well. 

Transition: 
Now we will see what kind of phrases you should use while interacting with the guest and when you are on your job.

¬†
Say: The purpose of any business is to provide goods and services to satisfy the needs of the customer and to succeed in making them its regular guests and so is the purpose of a restaurant. Customer relationship management is important for all businesses. Like any other business the hotel business must establish very good relationship with its guests showing great concern and genuine interest in serving them which will make them regular guests. There should be a bond between the business and the customers which can be built through quality and friendly service. To make regular customers, all the policies and procedures should be customer-oriented. The guest relations are short, formal and professional.

We learnt that efficient, prompt and courteous service gives credit and recommendation to the employees.
Now tell me, what happens when you see a guest from a distance who has a lot of reasons for unhappiness?
Elicit answers from the learners.

Say:
It was good to know your views. In this particular case the guest seems uncomfortable but has not complained about anything yet. You are anticipating guest‚Äôs problem and needs. 
An unhappy customer can be made into a loyal guest by following few simple steps. The key is to be calm, attentive and empathetic towards the guest. We must understand that the guest(who may be unreasonable at times) is actually uncomfortable with something in the perimeter of the hotel your are working in. 
After identifying an unhappy customer, raise an action alert in the system to inform your colleagues about your judgment about the said guest. 
Make a direct contact ‚Äì Go to the guest and ask if there is something that is troubling him? How may you help him?
Listen to the guest and let them finish. Apologies for the inconvenience caused and proceed to find a solution. For the guest you represent the entire organization at that point in time.
Offer the solution and let guest decide if they would want to go ahead with it. If not raise and action alert and inform your manager. The manager should make a direct contact.
A resolution to the solution is found at this step which should be put into action immediately.

Great job! could have been better happy with it tall]]

üìù Notes:
Say: 
What leads a guest to complaint or compliment? Guests have a certain level of expectation. When we offer our services to the guest, the guest evaluates our service and compares it to his expectations. When the perceived level of service is below the expected level the guest feels dissatisfied and this leads to complaints. On the other hand, when the perceived level of service is higher than the expected level of service the guest feels satisfied and happy and gives compliments. Our aim to provide the services which are above the expected level of service. This will ensure good relations with the guest.

Define Complaints

Every customer has a potential to be satisfied or dissatisfied with your business. 
An expression of dissatisfaction is called complaints. 
Complaint v/s Objections:
Complaint: The sweets that I bought in the morning were stale.
Objection: Are these sweets fresh?

üìù Notes:
Say:
Every customer has a potential to be satisfied or dissatisfied with your business. They may or may not like your service at times. They would definitely want to bring it to your notice. An expression of dissatisfaction is called complaints. 

Now some guests might want to object too?

Ask:
Can anyone tell me what is meant by objection?

Possible answers
To object some thing
To go against 
I don‚Äôt know

Say:
You all are absolutely right. Objection comes when there is an apprehension in any idea. When a guest would be having a confilcting idea in his/her mind and has too many doubts about a situation.
For example let‚Äôs see,
Complaint v/s Objections:
Complaint: The sweets that I bought in the morning were stale.
Objection: Are these sweets fresh?

The complaint statement is definite and sure. The objection statement is actually a question and hence a doubt.

Activity-1, Group Activity ‚Äì Draw it

Roles of men and women in the world of work.

üìù Notes:
Activity_1: Instructions:
Invite ten volunteers to take up a 2 minutes‚Äô challenge.
Inform learners that they are required to draw their basic understanding only. Emphasis is on their idea of the person being drawn and not on the drawing.
Ensure no learner gets conscious regarding their drawing. This activity is to make learners realise that they themselves may have certain blindfolds regarding gender. 
While giving instructions for the activity ensure that you do not say anything that indicates gender. Learners will express their conceptions of the roles of men and women in the world of work.
¬†
Say:
Are you ready for a 2 min ‚ÄòDraw it‚Äô challenge? I will ask you to draw pictures of 4 people. You get only 2 minutes per drawing. We need only a basic idea about these people. You can draw all on one sheet of paper. 
Draw a farmer, a football player, a domestic help, a nurse. 

Note: Give 2 minutes for each drawing. Once the drawings are complete, ask learners to paste their respective drawings on the wall and observe others drawings. Ask learners to Compare the drawings. Give 5 minutes for this. 

Ask: What do you observe? 
<Learners will share general observations. >
¬†
Ask: Are there any beliefs you have made? 
<Expected response ‚Äì Yes>
¬†
Ask: What are the beliefs?
Say: Majority of Farmers and football players are Males. Majority of domestic help and nurses are females.
¬†
Ask: What is basis of those beliefs? Do u think it‚Äôs true? Yes or No? Are these beliefs valid? Yes or No?
<Expected response ‚Äì No>
Ask: Can only men be farmers or football players? 
<Expected response: No>
Say: Women too can be farmer‚Äôs/football players. Similarly, men can also do a job of nurse or domestic help. 
¬†
Note: Encourage learners to share their opinion/idea or example of females as football players/farmers and men as domestic help/nurse. 
¬†
Debrief:
Say: These assumptions are subconscious views about farmers and football players as males and domestic helps and nurses as females. However, it is not necessarily so.

 This view that we all have a blindfold (disbelief) and it is necessary to identify such blindfolds and remove them. 
<Make sure that learners get familiar with the term ‚Äòblindfold‚Äô>
¬†
Ask: Name few other similar blindfolds? 
Possible answers:
Women can‚Äôt drive.
Boys don‚Äôt cry.
Men take financial decisions. 
Girls cannot be good at sports. 
¬†
Say: We will now enlist some more blindfolds that you yourself carry or have observed in society, home and office (if applicable).

Suggest the learners to make a table as drawn below, if required.
Give 5 minutes to do this activity.
¬†
Blindfolds at Home
Blindfolds in Society
Blindfolds at Workplace
¬†¬†
<after the learner‚Äôs finish enlisting blindfolds>

Ask: What is the effect/impact of such blindfolds? 
Possible answers:
These blindfolds not only affect a person but they also harm the society.
They restrict the freedom to live. 
They hamper the potential of an individual. 
¬†
Ask: What does it lead to?
<after generating response>
Say: It leads to Gender stereotyping. These blindfolds are nothing but Gender stereotypes and one of the topics we are going to discuss today is Gender Sensitivity.

Use this section to share a story of gender stereotyping.
Read out the story in a medium pace so that all learners understand.
Offer to repeat or summarise the story if required. 
¬†
Say: 
Let us imagine that twins have been born to someone we know. One of them is a boy and the other a girl. The girls‚Äô name is Sangeeta and boys‚Äô name is Mukesh.
<After six years> 
They are now six years old. Mukesh plays with a bat and ball. He plays the game out in the open, away from home. Therefore, Mukesh gets a chance to go out, to lean and to cross a road., to learn and negotiate with children of his age; he gets fresh air, his muscles develop, his appetite grows and he learns to face the big bad world outside his home. He becomes tough, he learns to handle situations on his own and soon earns the confidence of his parents. They begin to trust him with outdoor work an involve him in decision-making too. On the other hand, Sangeeta plays with the doll and kitchen set. This game is played inside the home, in the kitchen or in the corner of leaving room. Her parents ask her, ‚Äò‚ÄôWhat did you cooked today? How is your doll? What does your doll like to eat?‚Äô‚Äô 
<After five years>
After five years, Sangeeta and Mukesh get bored and want to exchange their toys. Their parents say to Sangeeta, ‚Äò‚ÄôYou will be the only girl, how can you play with the boys?‚Äô‚Äô and to Mukesh they say, ‚Äò‚ÄôOh no, why do you want to behave like girls? I hope no one notices him play with the dolls.‚Äô‚Äô This way both the siblings are forced to play with their respective toys.
<After seven years> 
Sangeeta and Mukesh are now 18 years old. Both have passed their higher secondary school(HSC) with first class. Sangeeta and Mukesh are discussing what course should they be doing after HSC? Mukesh tells his parents that he would like to pursue his career in fashion designing and Sangeeta says that she wants to be a police officer. After knowing their children‚Äôs interest, their parents get worried. They say to Mukesh that the career he wants to pursue is mainly led by women and being a boy they want him to opt for an engineering course.  Sangeeta‚Äôs father said to her that she will not be able to carry out the duties of a police officer as the police department is dominated by men and you should just finish your graduation, get married and take care of your home and family the same way your mother has been doing so far. 
¬†
Note: End the story here. Pause for a while. Ask the learners what they have to say after listening the story.  Get their opinion. Do not be judgemental about their opinion.

Activity
Instruction:
Walk around the class and speak with 4 people (preferably 2 boys & 2 girls; if the class has all boys or all girls then facilitator may ask half of the class to role play the opposite gender and respond accordingly)
You have to ask as well as tell the learners about ‚ÄòSomething that you wish to do but you cannot do it because you are a boy or a girl.‚Äô
Let the participants share only those things that they are comfortable with. Do not force any one to share anything that they do not like.

Gender Stereotype

‚Äπ#‚Ä∫

üìù Notes:
Debrief:
Ask: What did you learn/observe/realize?
<After generating response>
Say:
Many people have wishes that can be fulfilled, but they don‚Äôt do it because of the blindfolds that we had spoken about. These blindfolds come from friends, society, family, colleagues etc. This blindfold is called Gender Stereotype, as discussed earlier and we need to identify and remove these blindfolds.
Ask: 
What is gender stereotype?
Say: 
Gender Stereotype - A conventional or formulaic conception or image.
¬†
Ask: Where do these Gender stereotypes come from? 
Possible answers: 
Family
Society
Friends
Parents
Peers 
Siblings
¬†
Ask: Are these stereotypes valid? 
<Expected response ‚Äì no/ majorly no.>
Say:
Gender stereotype affects most of us, directly or indirectly. When we unconsciously try to live up to these stereotypes or expect others to follow it, we can do physical and/ or emotional harm to ourselves or others. often, we do not notice this because we tend to mold ourselves to fit into these stereotypes as a matter of course. This can be damaging. A boy with very slight build who wants to be muscle-bound is fighting against himself if he tries to change his physique to match that of the stereotypical male. A dark girl would never be able to accept herself. It takes conviction, self - assurance and courage to accept oneself despite the disapproval of others. Being accepted by others and pushing self to fit-in is not as important as self - acceptance. 
¬†
Note: Give 2 minutes to the learners to reflect on what you have shared. 
Ask: 
What are the ways you can avoid or overcome gender stereotype at work, at home and in society? 
<Give 5 minutes for the same>

Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace

üìù Notes:
Say: Now, we will discuss a very important aspect related to working in hotels. Most of the employers these days are equal opportunity employers that is they do not discriminate based on the gender. Sexual harassment at workplace or other than workplace if involving an employee or employees is a very severe offence and hence punishable. 
¬†
All employees are expected to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct at the workplace. The employees have a responsibility to 
Treat each other with dignity and respect
Follow the rules and regulations
Refrain from any unwelcome behaviour of sexual nature
Refrain from creating any hostile environment by way of sexual harassment
Report sexual harassment experienced and/or witnessed to appropriate authorities and follow the complaint handling procedure of the company. 
¬†
Sexual harassment includes any one or more of the following unwelcome acts or behaviour (whether directly or by implication): 
a) Any unwelcome sexually determined behaviour, or pattern of conduct, that would cause discomfort and/or humiliate a person at whom the behaviour or conduct was directed namely: i. Physical contact and advances; 
ii. Demand or request for sexual favours; 
iii. Sexually couloured remarks or remarks of a sexual nature about a person's clothing or body; 
iv. Showing pornography, making or posting sexual pranks, sexual teasing, sexual jokes, sexually demeaning or offensive pictures, cartoons or other materials through email, SMS, MMS etc.; 
v. Repeatedly asking to socialize during off-duty hours or continued expressions of sexual interest against a person‚Äôs wishes; 
vi. Giving gifts or leaving objects that are sexually suggestive; 
vii. Eve teasing, innuendos and taunts, physical confinement against one‚Äôs will or any such act likely to intrude upon one‚Äôs privacy; 
viii. Persistent watching, following, contacting of a person; and 
ix. Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature 
¬†
To prevent instances of sexual harassment and to receive and effectively deal with complaints pertaining to the same, an "Internal Complaints Committee" is constituted in the organisation. If any complaint is to be made it has to be submitted in written with in three months from the day, the incidence happened. Under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the newly introduced section which deals with sexual harassment at workplace states that a person charged with sexual harassment may be arrested without warrant.
¬†
As a Front office professional it is important for you to know both, your rights as an employee and the code of conduct expected from you.

Equal Remuneration Act,1976
Equal payment to men and women workers.

Laws by the Government

‚Äπ#‚Ä∫

üìù Notes:
Say: 
Mostly, it has been observed that women face more gender bias issues as compared to men and hence there was need to safeguard their rights. Hence, many companies have now taken up gender sensitivity seriously and have made many rules or policies. Similarly, the government has also made amendments in the law and made many policies as well. 
Government of India has laws relating to Equality and Empowerment of women such as ‚Äì 
Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 - The¬†Equal Remuneration Act, 1976¬†aims to provide for the payment of equal remuneration to men and women workers and for the prevention of discrimination, on the ground of sex, against women in the matter of employment and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

Say:
Lets play a guessing game. There are some pictures on the screen.
Can any of you tell me what these pictures were for?
Click and Ask learners at random to identify the product with logo or with the slogan. 

Engage the learners in discussion while trying to identify the products.  Where they must have seen the logo or heard the jingle. At this point can talk about childhood memories too and how specific advertisements make us remember the particular product we used to use or consume.

Say: Waah. That did remind me of my childhood. I m sure I am aging now!!
Now lets see if you all were right in identifying the product.
Click for each picture to reveal the answers. 

Say: Now all those are the products that are etched in our minds. They just remind us all about our childhood memories. These slogans or jingles are only the property of respective brands.
The rights are reserved by each brand, that means ‚Äì No other product can have the same slogan, picture, font or jingle. For example Amul girl can only be seen in Amul butter products and no other company butter. IF anybody tries to copy the concept or the Amul girl for advertising their brands, legal action can be taken. It is pretty serious!!

Similarly no other hotel brand can use Taj Hotels logo. The dot on the letter ‚ÄòJ‚Äù is only owned by Taj Hotels. No one else can write it the same way. It is the INTELLUCTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT of Taj Hotels to show their logo in this design. If anybody tries to copy it, legal action can be taken.

Possible answers:
Ability to think and understand

<after generating response>

Say:
Thank you for your answers. 
Intelligence and intellect are used as terms describing mental ability (or¬†abilities) that allow people to¬†understand. A distinction is sometimes made whereby intellect is considered to be related to "facts" in contrast to intelligence concerning "feelings".
Intellect¬†is a term used in studies of the¬†human¬†mind, and refers to the ability of the mind to come to correct conclusions about what is true¬†or¬†real, and about how to¬†solve problems.¬†Intellect is often considered to be a branch of¬†intelligence¬†reflecting mainly its logical and rational side.
Because of the lack of¬†emotional¬†and sensitive engagement, intellect is sometimes considered to be strictly limited to the¬†facts¬†and not going beyond mere raw knowledge.
Now we will know what does Intellectual Property means. However, before that can anyone tell me what is Monopoly?
<after generating response>

Say: A¬†monopoly¬†( "alone" or "single") ("to sell")) exists when a specific person or¬†enterprise¬†is the only supplier of a particular commodity.
Now as we all know what intellect and monopoly means, we will now know what Intellectual Property means.

‚Äπ#‚Ä∫

Intellectual Property Rights

üìù Notes:
Say:
Hence we understood, 
IPR or Intellectual property rights primarily encompasses copyrights, patents, and trademarks of any company.
It also includes other types of rights, such as trade secrets, publicity rights, moral rights, and rights against unfair competition.
Artistic works including music and literature, as well as discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs can all be protected as intellectual property. We will learn about them one by one.


Click after each example to reveal the next example.
Trademarks are logos, for example the way STRIVE is written in TATA STRIVE.
Patents are licenses or rights that are owned by the company. 
Copyright means - No one else has right to copy our product.
Trade secret is like the secret recipe of Apple kheer in Varq. It cannot be leaked to other hotels.  
Another important example is information of the guest. You as front office associate will have all the information pertaining to the guest such as their contact information, company, room number and other whereabouts. ‚ÄòIT‚Äô is important not to disclose any of it to unauthorized person.
Layout design means the architectural structure right. For example the tomb of Taj Mumbai is unique to Taj hotels and cannot be copied by anyone else.
Industrial Design is like blue print of the hotel. Imagine if unauthorized and suspicious people catch a hold of our hotels blueprint, it can bring about a large amount of threat to the hotel for its safety and security.
 
Therefore we can say IPR are set of rules that you as employee of our organization have to follow indefinitely. These information can not be shared or leaked or used outside the organizational structure.
We have to make sure new initiatives of Hotel are not leaked out.

A¬†patent¬†is a form of right granted by the government to an inventor, giving the owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing an invention¬†for a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, which may be a product or a process and generally has to fulfil three main requirements: it has to be new, not obvious and there needs to be an industrial applicability.

üìù Notes:
To fight with Infringement, Integrity should be in place. Let us now talk about one very important attribute of a Front office professional that is Integrity in detail. Integrity is the quality of having strong moral principles. As a FRONT OFFICE staff you have access to lot of confidential information about the organisation. As a FRONT OFFICE staff it is your duty to 
¬†
Prevent leak of new plans and designs of your organisation to the competitors.
Be aware not to disclose any of company‚Äôs product, service or design patents. 
Not to share any information related to stay of any guest.
Protect leak of any information related to customer‚Äôs business or design plans. This is also right to privacy of the guest.
Consult supervisor or senior management when in doubt about using information available from customer.
¬†
You may be approached by a competitor to share information about your organisation to them. Before sharing any information consult your senior or supervisor because it may be confidential information which can be used by competitor. Sharing of such information falls under violation of Intellectual property rights and may lead to legal action.
¬†
To be successful in the FRONT OFFICE service, you must have these attributes in your personality.

Case study

Namaste. This is Deepa. How may I help you?

Good morning. I am neighbor of Mr. Sharma from Delhi who is staying in your hotel. Can I please know till when is he staying there. I have some urgent work with him.

üìù Notes:
Say:
Imagine a situation.
You get a call from an unknown person. He says he is neighbor of Mr. Sharma who has come from Delhi. 
He says that he has some urgent work with him. He is keen to know till when is Mr. Sharma staying in the hotel. 

You are aware That Mr. Sharma is checking out tomorrow. 

What will you do?

Engage learners in discussion for about 10 minutes, and elicit response. 

After discussion say,
In no capacity or how much ever is the situation you must not tell anybody(un-authorized) person the details of your guest.
It is important to always remember this. Firstly we really do not know if the calling person is actually Mr. Sharma‚Äôs  neighbor. And if he is so how did he know that Mr. Sharma was staying your hotel. Why does he not have Mr. Sharma‚Äôs personal number and why is he calling on hotel‚Äôs board number. 
These are only a few questions that should raise suspicion in us. The unknown man calling could be a threat to the guest or the hotel.
Any information about the guest is also IPR ‚Äì Intellectual property right. If it is breached the employee can face legal consequences.

üìù Notes:
Transition: 
Say:
I will now summarise today‚Äôs session. Thank you for your active participation in the activity. That was great! 
Instructions:
Before summarising, ask the learners to give one point each that they remember from today‚Äôs class.
Spend about 15 minutes in collating points from the learners.
¬†
Say:
I would like you to recall the points that you learnt today.
¬†
Note: Ask the learners to volunteer to share a point. Else, choose the learners who did not participate much in the discussions for recalling a point.
¬†
Say: 
In this session, Gender Sensitivity and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) you have learnt that:
Gender stereotypes¬†are simplistic generalizations about the¬†gender¬†attributes, differences, and roles of individuals and/or groups.¬†Stereotypes¬†can be positive or negative, but they rarely communicate accurate information about others.
Gender sensitivity or gender sensitization refers to the modification of behaviour by raising awareness of gender equality concerns. This can be achieved by conducting various sensitivity campaigns, workshop, programs etc. Gender sensitivity may be seen as "the awareness informed nature or tendency to behave in a manner which is sensitive to gender justice and equality issues."
Gender sensitizing "is about changing behaviour and instilling empathy into the views that we hold about our own and the other gender." It helps people in "examining their personal attitudes and beliefs and questioning the 'realities' they thought they know.
Mostly, it has been observed that women face more gender bias issues as compared to men and hence there was need to safeguard their rights.
Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creations of the¬†intellect¬†for which a¬†monopoly¬†is assigned to designated owners by¬†law. 
Intellectual property rights (IPRs) are the protections granted to the creators of IP, and include¬†trademarks,¬†copyright,¬†patents, industrial, and in some jurisdictions¬†trade secrets.¬†
The stated objective of most intellectual property law (with the exception of trademarks) is to "Promote progress." 
Violation of intellectual property rights, called "infringement" with respect to patents, copyright, and trademarks, and "misappropriation" with respect to trade secrets, may be a breach of civil law or criminal law, depending on the type of intellectual property involved, jurisdiction, and the nature of the action.
Note: Distribute the hand-out ‚Äò‚ÄôGender sensitivity and IPR‚Äô‚Äô to the learners. 
¬†
Say:
We will end our session with this. Hope you all had good time learning interesting things about Gender Sensitivity and IPR. I will now distribute the hand-outs on ‚ÄôGender sensitivity and IPR‚Äô that you can use for your future reference.

Say: That felt good. Right?
Breathing is good for health. When we breathe, our brain functions right and we think right. When the brain is calm and composed the decisions taken will be in the right direction.
Calm and deep breathing is healthy and vital for carrying out every function effectively‚Ä¶but peacefully. In our practical life as a front office associate we will taking a lot of decisions, many in emergency situations. When we take them, we have to be sure that they are taken calmly and not in panic, anger or anxiety. 
Breathing right will help.
So while we go through todays session we will breathe in and out, several times, consciously to remain active and energetic throughout.

We feel safe and secure in our homes.

Ensure food safety

Our guests should feel just as safe and secure in our hotels.

As Front office associate, we must also be safe and secure in our workplace.

[[OCR Image Text: Think Safe...

üìù Notes:
Say: 
We feel safe and secure in our homes and we ensure that the food we eat is safe. Our guests should feel just as safe and secure when they visit us and the food we serve them should be safe for them. And while we serve our guests, we ought to remain safe and secure at our workplace.
Similarly, the safety of the guests is also important and many of you may have noticed fire extinguishers placed at strategic locations, floor maps and fire escape routes displays, signs and instructions related to safety, and various other safety and security regulations being followed in food service operations. 
To achieve these goals, we need to be aware of and adhere to certain industry-standard safety regulations. I am happy to be sharing my experiences and discussing our views on this subject.

Safe food
Provision of safe food for employees and the guests
Food handlers should be empowered

Biological Hazard - Food safety and environmental concerns

üìù Notes:
Global Instructions:
This is the core instruction section of this session.
Use the PPT slides appropriately with the concepts that you cover.
Move the session with discussions, explanations and examples. 
Whenever you ask a question, organise a small discussion with the learners. Proceed to the Say part after you have completed the discussion. 
Keep the discussion open to all learners and encourage them to participate.
Be open to diverse views from the learners.
Write the keywords from the discussions that are closely associated with the content of this session on the board.
Observe if the learners change their views or exhibit comprehension of the concepts at various points in the discussions.
After you complete a section of the theory, distribute the handouts and ask the learners to go through them and review their understanding.
¬†
Say: We will learn about health first. We did a bit of breathing exercise to improve our health. Health is also determined by the food we eat. We are in a hospitality industry and all the employees working in the hotel represent both room and dining services available in it. Therefore even when we are in front office we have to be sure of the safety of the food served in the hotel.

Ask: Do you know what is food poisoning?
¬†
Possible Answers:
Food becomes poisonous
We have stomach ache and vomiting
I don‚Äôt know


Say:
Food poisoning is a condition that happens when we do not consume safe food. Safe food refers to food that is free from harmful bacterial and chemical contamination.  
Provision of safe food is the prime responsibility of the hotel. As hotels comprises of both room and dining services, food provided for employees and the guests should be absolutely safe to consume.
The health of the customers is in the hands of food handlers and, therefore, they should be empowered and supported so that the customers are provided with safe and quality food.

[[OCR Image Text: GETS SICK FROM

WANTS HOTEL FRONT DESK EMPLOYEE
ARE]]

üìù Notes:
Say: One interesting incident happened in a very renowned hotel one day.
Mr. George was very hungry. He thought of ordering a nice hot pizza. He did not have patience to go through the menu that was kept in the room. 
He picked up the phone, saw one big button that said ‚ÄúFRONT DESK‚Äù. It was the only button on the phone that was bright and red. He did not think about calling room service, and pressed that red button.
He was so hungry after all.
One very polite young man at the front desk answered the phone and addressed Mr. George. He said ‚ÄúGood afternoon Mr. George, How may I help you?‚Äù
Mr. George hurriedly says ‚ÄúI am very hungry, I want a simple margarita pizza in my room ASAP‚Äù. And he disconnected the call.
The front desk associate placed the order for Pizza with In room dining services and it was delivered to Mr. George‚Äôs room.
After around 3 hours Mr. George called again on the red button.
Can you guess what button that was for? (Question to see if the learners are attentive to the story. Click once to reveal the complete slide)
Say: Yes, absolutely right! He called the front desk agent again. Mr. George went sick after having the pizza and was very upset. He screamed at the front desk agent and said he will talk to the higher management and get him fired. I know.. Very unfortunate it is!!

Now, imagine you are that young front desk agent who must have answered that call. What will you do next?

Keep the discussion for about 5 mins. Move to next slide.

Food poisoning is an illness characterized by stomach pains and diarrhea and sometimes vomiting, developing within 1 to 36 hours after consuming the contaminated food.

Food poisoning

üìù Notes:
Say: That was a great effort.
Mr. George must have got sick. We as hospitality personnel must empathize for his situation.  But also remember that we are not certified medical authority. Remember at this point : NEVER suggest remedies or medicines to the guest. ( Re-emphasize)
 Mr. George is upset and hence angry. Try to be understanding and compassionate towards him. If there is a manager around, transfer the call to him/ her immediately.
Listen to him for as long as he would want to express his discomfort. Then offer someone from the hotel who has the authority ‚Äì like your manager/ supervisor or hotel doctor to visit him in the room for further course of action.
From this point onwards a formal protocol shall be followed that will have a detailed investigation on why Mr. George got sick.

It is important to know for knowledge that:
Food poisoning is an illness characterized by stomach pains and diarrhea and sometimes vomiting, developing within 1 to 36 hours after consuming the contaminated food.

Chemical food poisoning






     Bacterial food poisoning

Types of Food Poisoning

üìù Notes:
Say: Now let us discuss the types of food poisoning. Food may be contaminated by the following:

Chemical food poisoning: occurs when the chemicals accidentally contaminate food. Like if any residue is left behind on the cooking equipment. And that chemical enters the dish. It can also happen when chemicals are spread on vegetables and fruits during cultivation or due to application of pesticides in storage area may contaminate the goods in the store.


Bacterial food poisoning: occurs when food is contaminated by harmful bacteria. It happens if incase the food is spoilt or food handler is not clean or is sick. In that case there are chances for the bacteria to enter the dish. Bacteria thrive in warm and moist foods.

We saw health concerns for the guests. Now what about the internal customers- hotel staff?
Give a pause here.

One of the perks in the hotel industry is delicious food for staff in the hotel cafeteria. You get all meals at the hotel cafeteria to avail as per the policy. As the  cafeteria feeds all the staff of the hotel, health of the food handlers and hygiene standards followed are of very high standards. 
Hence the health of the employees are also important so that they are fit to deliver world class service.
And yes, do remember to thank the cafeteria once in few days. They do a great job by giving us safe tasty food to eat.

The picture is of a man smoking ‚Äì Must not smoke during duty hours, and if done then hands and mouth must be washed and swished.
Digging nose in public is a big no. 
Soiled uniform tells about no commitment towards personal hygiene.
Hair follicles have dirt and bacteria. Touching hair and then touching other things can spread germs and infections. Hair should be neatly tied and groomed.
Dirty nails are such a bad site to see. Nails must be trimmed and hands perfectly cleaned at all times.
While thinking or making decision we must not put finger on our lips or anywhere in the face. It also shows lack of confidence and anxiety.
Pimples and acnes on the face and hand should be treated immediately. If there is any outbreak on the face or body it should be given medical attention.

Great. As we saw this is a typical workstation in an office.
It has a laptop and a mug of black coffee.
It is also unorganized and messy.
What if the coffee spills and goes over the laptop or the paper?

Let the learners answer the question.

Say: True the laptop will get destroyed and the work will be lost. Such a waste of time and effort. No?

The mental wellbeing of people at¬†work¬†is good for everyone and enhances personal and organizational spirit and success. Every associate has a role to play, both in looking after their own¬†mental health¬†and creating a mentally healthy¬†workplace. 
Front desk is a key area in the hotel through which a lot of decisions, guest and employee traffic passes through. A lot of decisions have to be taken every minute and the staff is always on the go. It can be mentally pressuring at times. 
A small break for fresh air or a timely snack with a very positive attitude will make a difference to your health and your environment. A happy employee is a healthy employee.

During the 26/11 terrorists attack, the property damaged in the Taj Mahal Palace was huge. It could have been more had it not been for the safety measures already in place in the hotel.

Safety and security is not the prerogative of any one person in the hotel.

[[OCR Image Text: www.shutterstock.com - 320347751]]

üìù Notes:
The fictional story. Read on medium pace.
¬†
Say: We will read about an incident that happened few years back and shocked the entire hotel industry.
Background of the story - Deepesh is a Guest service executive and he is highlighting the role of Front office associates in ensuring that the guests have a safe and secure time. 
Deepesh uses the 26/11 terrorist attack on the Taj Mahal Palace and the Oberoi Trident hotels as an example. 
He says, ‚ÄúThe property damaged in the attack, especially in the Taj Mahal Palace was huge. Several antique pieces of furniture and valuable paintings were damaged by fire. Because the hotel had adopted certain fire-prevention safety regulations, the tragedy was much lesser than what it could have been. The hotel had installed fire-proof doors on the guestrooms because of which the guests were safe and the fire could not spread. The hotel also had a fire-proof finish on all its curtains, mattresses and sheets. This too prevented fire from spreading. This is just an example of how important it is to be aware of and adhere to safety regulations.‚Äù
¬†
Say:
Safety and security is not the prerogative of any one person in the food service operations, but for us in Front office associate, we must make it a principle to adhere to safety regulations.

I could get trapped inside an elevator.
I could get an electric shock.
I could cut my finger.
¬†
Say:
Good! I agree with your answers. In India, we follow the IS 15001: 2000 Indian Standards on Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems ‚ÄìSpecifications and Guidelines for Use as the reference on the safety regulations. It helps if we know what are the risks or the safety hazards we are looking to prevent. There are some potential safety hazards in Food service operations. 
¬†
You can easily suffer from falls. Most fall accidents occur because of someone‚Äôs carelessness and occur mainly because of tripping on uneven flooring, frayed edges of carpets, equipment and articles left lying about, using a stool instead of ladder and so on. You can even fall when the lighting is poor or when spills are not cleaned immediately leading to slippery floors. 

The next potential hazard is cuts and abrasions. You must handle knives, razors and blades carefully while placing them. Similarly, disposal of broken glass also needs care. Other hazards include opening of tin cans and stacking of tins. 
Do you know that if you are not careful you can get a cut from the edge of the paper. Interesting , isn‚Äôt it. A small petty thing can give so much pain if not careful.
¬†
Let‚Äôs continue to discover more potential hazards.

Those were interesting answers from all of you. Burns and scalds are also common in the line of our duty. We can easily burn ourselves if we are careless when filling hot water bottles or disposing of cigarette butts. We need to be aware that newspapers lying too close to fire or covering lamps and heaters with clothing pose a safety hazard. We must also be careful while placing candles on the tables.

üìù Notes:
Say:
Often we use the terms safety and security interchangeably as both terms relate to protecting human and physical assets. However, we use the term safety to refer to emergencies, disasters, accidents and incidents that could lead to serious damage. Security, on the other hand, we generally use to indicate our freedom from fear, anxiety, stress and doubts related to our lives or physical assets. We associate security with protection against terrorist attacks, theft and fire.

Team A: Bomb threat
Team B: Handling Theft
Team C: Fire prevention and Fire-fighting

Allow each team to discuss within the team for 10 minutes.
Encourage each team to share their discussion points with the class.
Conclude with a small debrief introducing the security aspects.
Ensure this activity does not exceed 30 minutes.
¬†
Say:
Front office associates should be security-minded and should be aware that they should not leak out information. FOA must also adhere to security regulations on handling keys and comply with the safety measures in case of bomb threats, fires, thefts or assaults. Let‚Äôs have a small activity on this. For the activity, let‚Äôs form three teams: Bomb threats, theft and fire. Pick your choice of team.
 
Note: Allow the learners to pick their team. However, try to have the teams of near about equal size. You can encourage some learner to move to another team to make the teams of equal size.
¬†
Say:
Now, all teams will get 10 minutes to discuss within themselves. What each one of you, within your team, must discuss is how the assigned topic poses a security risk and what kind of safety and security regulations can prevent them. This activity is not to see how well you know the regulations, most of us will not even know them‚Ä¶but rather it is to make you think about the risks around you. It will help you remain alert always. So, let‚Äôs get started, shall we?
 
Note: Allow the teams 10 minutes of discussion time. Circulate and observe the conversations. You can contribute suggestions, ideas or ask them some probing questions to get them share their ideas. Encourage them by asking them to think about movie halls, hotels and other public places and what signs or security measures they see there. 
¬†
Say:
Now, that was nice talk, wasn‚Äôt it? So, let‚Äôs also hear what you all discussed. One representative from each team can share the team‚Äôs observations with the class.

Detain the messenger in case of any suspicion. 
If you overhear any bomb threat being made, immediately report it. 
Part of the search team. 
Evacuations plans. 
And AVOID PANIC.

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Explain the safety regulations to be followed to handle bomb threats.
¬†
Say:
After the 26/11 terrorist attacks, hotels have been identified as soft targets for terrorists. Bomb threats have become common. We can receive bomb threats through letters, emails, or over the phone. Most of these turn out to be pranks or tricks, but nevertheless we cannot afford to let any threat go unchecked or taken less seriously. 
¬†
It is our responsibility to be prepared to handle bomb threats. When handling envelops, packages and so on delivered for a guest or someone working at the hotel, we must cross check and detain the messenger or delivery man in case of any suspicion. In case, any front office associate overhears any person making a bomb threat within the hotel premises, the associate must immediately report the person to the security personnel. It will help if we can note the physical appearance and attire of the person in such cases to provide a good description. Front office associates may also be a part of the search team looking for any unidentified, unclaimed or foreign object that could contain a bomb within the premises. Front office associates must be aware of the evacuations plans and must assist in evacuating the premises in case need arises. While handling a bomb threat, we must aim to reduce the damage, find a speedy solution and avoid panic.

Prevention is better than cure. 
Prevent a terrorist attack  by:
Local police. 
Controlled access to public areas. 
Adequate lighting and fencing,

Explain the safety regulations to be followed to prevent the implantation of a bomb in the property.
¬†
Say:
Prevention is better than cure. So, let‚Äôs first learn the measures we can take to prevent a terrorist from implanting a bomb within the hotel premises. We can contact the local police for security in the neighbourhood. We can ensure we have a controlled access to public areas. We can provide adequate lighting and fencing, separate parking areas for staff and public, visible security patrol and a good burglar alarm among the various measures. Trees and vegetation on the premises should be kept well-trimmed so that no one can hide or use these to get unauthorised entry into the premises.

A physical security plan 
Bomb incident plan 
Check surveillance systems 
Clear line of command
Leader for each area
Effective decision-making and communication

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Explain the safety regulations to be followed for bomb threat situations.
¬†
Say:
While we adopt measures to prevent bombs from being planted, we must also plan for a situation where there could be a bomb within the premises. Once we get a bomb threat, we have to handle the situation as if there is really a bomb planted on the premises. To handle the emergency situation, we should have a physical security plan and a bomb incident plan in place. The physical security plan details how we can physically ensure there are no bombs within the premises. This includes a physical check on all potential areas as well as the checking of surveillance systems on the people entering the property. The bomb incident plan defines the clear line of command, leader for each area and easy access to the command for effective decision-making and communication during a bomb incident.

üìù Notes:
Slide Number: 24
Instructions:
Explain the three sweep method for a bomb search.
¬†
Say:
Since we may be in the team looking for bomb within the premises, we must be aware of the three sweep method used to locate bombs. During the first sweep, we search for any object which might be containing a bomb, placed till waist height. The second sweep will have us looking for suspicious objects till the height of our chins. In the third sweep, we will check all the areas located above the chin level.
¬†
Ask:
Do you think you can now handle a bomb threat situation?
¬†
Note: Look for an enthusiastic ‚Äòyes‚Äô. This question is just to provide a bit of relief from the monologue.

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Explain the measures to be taken to prevent theft.
Probe the learners to highlight how they need to comply with security measures.
¬†
Say: Let us now explore how to prevent theft. Every hotel has a safe or safe deposit boxes and guests are asked not to leave their valuables lying around. All valuables found have to be reported to the Manager. It is the responsibility of front office department to check its validation and maintenance.
The backgrounds of Front office associates are thoroughly checked prior to issuing their offer of employment. Orientation programs for FOA emphasise honesty. Uniforms are colour-coded and identification badges are issued to ensure only authorised persons have the access to guestrooms. 
¬†
Ask: If the hotel security regulations asked you to comply with frisking or allowing your personal belongings to be checked when leaving the premises, how will you feel?
¬†
Possible answers:
Not happy. Feel privacy has been violated
It is part of the regulations to ensure guests feel secure during their stay, so nothing personal.
¬†
Say: We must always remember that our larger goal is to make our guests feel safe and secure. If by way of our little gesture of allowing ourselves and our belongings to be checked, the threat of thefts is curbed, then we should happily abide.

Electrical short circuit 
Candle placed near a curtain 
LPG leak
Fireworks being burst 
Improper disposal of cigarette butts

üìù Notes:
Say: Wonderful. Fires can be started rather easily. A simple electrical short circuit or a candle placed near a curtain can easily set off a fire. The kitchen can be dangerous if there is a leak in the liquefied petroleum gas or LPG supply. Fireworks being burst can also cause a fire if we are not careful. Cigarette butts discarded without proper care can cause fires. Needless to say that since the risk of a fire is high, we have to undertake numerous safety measures. This generally means that it becomes a challenge to adhere to all safety regulations all the time. However, we need to be aware of and comply with safety regulations for prevention of fire and fire-fighting to minimise the dangers of fire.

Fire Triangle

51

METHOD 1

METHOD 2

NO FIRE

üìù Notes:
Say: We can understand how fires burn and spread and how we can control fires through something called as the Fire triangle.
¬†
Four things must be present at the same time in order to produce fire: 
¬†
Enough oxygen to sustain combustion, 
Enough heat to raise the material to its ignition temperature, 
Some sort of fuel or combustible material, and 
The chemical, exothermic reaction that is fire.
¬†
Oxygen, heat, and fuel are frequently referred to as the "fire triangle." Add in the fourth element, the chemical reaction, and you actually have a fire "tetrahedron." The important thing to remember is: take any of these four things away, and you will not have a fire or the fire will be extinguished.
¬†
Essentially, fire extinguishers put out fire by taking away one or more elements of the fire triangle/tetrahedron.
¬†
Fire safety, at its most basic, is based on the principle of keeping fuel sources and ignition sources separate.

Classification of Fire

¬© Tata Community Initiatives Trust (2015), all rights reserved.

52

Fires can be classified into four categories based on fuel.

üìù Notes:
Say: To understand fire-prevention and fire fighting, we must learn how fires are classified. Based on the source of fuel, fires can be classified into four groups. Class A fires are fuelled by solid combustible materials that are non metals such as wood, paper, cloth, trash and plastics. These fires generally leave an ash.
¬†
Class B fires are caused by flammable liquids: gasoline, oil, grease or acetone. The sources can be any non-metal in a liquid state, on fire. This classification also includes flammable gases. Class B fires generally involve materials that boil or bubble.
¬†
Class C fires are sourced by electricity. These electrical fires can be caused through energised electrical equipment.
As long as the equipment is "plugged in," it would be considered a class C fire. Class C fires generally deal with electrical current. 
¬†
Class D fires are fuelled by chemicals or metals such as potassium, sodium, aluminium, magnesium and so on. Unless you work in a laboratory or in an industry that uses these materials, it is unlikely you'll have to deal with a Class D fire. It takes special extinguishing agents such as Metal-X or foam to fight such a fire.

Fire Detection

¬© Tata Community Initiatives Trust (2015), all rights reserved.

54

Identify a developing fire emergency at the earliest possible time. 
The sooner we detect a fire situation, the easier it is to fire-fight and control the fire before it can cause any serious damage. There are several ways to detect fire.

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Briefly explain how to detect fires.
¬†
Ask:
Let me ask you a simple question. What do you do when your finger or part of your hand accidently is exposed to fire or something hot?
¬†
Possible answers:
I will automatically take my hand or finger out of contact from the fire.

¬†
Say:
Exactly. The best way to protect ourselves and our assets from fire is to identify a developing fire emergency at the earliest possible time. The sooner we detect a fire situation, the easier it is to fire-fight and control the fire before it can cause any serious damage. There are several ways to detect fire.
Manual fire detection is the oldest method of detection. In the simplest form, a person yelling can provide adequate fire warning.
¬†
Thermal detectors are the oldest type of automatic detection device. The most common units are fixed temperature devices that operate when the room reaches a predetermined temperature, usually in the 135¬∞-165¬∞F/57¬∞-74¬∞C. 
The second most common type of thermal sensor is the rate-of-rise detector, which identifies an abnormally fast temperature climb over a short time period. 
The third detector type is the fixed temperature line type detector, which consists of two cables and an insulated sheathing that is designed to breakdown when exposed to heat.
¬†
Smoke detectors are a much newer technology. These devices are designed to identify a fire while in its smouldering or in early flame stages, replicating the human sense of smell. The key advantage of smoke detectors is their ability to identify a fire while it is still in its incipient stage. The smoke detectors are set off by sensing smoke.
¬†
Flame detectors represent the third major type of automatic detection method, and imitate the human sense of sight. 
They are line-of-sight devices that operate on either an infrared, ultraviolet or combination principle. The advantage of a flame detector is that it is extremely reliable in a hostile environment. The disadvantage is that flame detectors can be very expensive and labour intensive to maintain.

you lack the adequate or appropriate equipment. 
the fire is producing large amounts of smoke.  
Always position yourself with an exit.

[[OCR Image Text: k17352804 fotosearch.com ¬©]]

üìù Notes:
Before deciding to fight the fire, you must identify what is burning. Depending on the fuel for the fire, use an appropriate fire extinguisher in the beginning stages of a fire. Do not fight the fire if you lack the adequate or appropriate equipment. If the fire is producing large amounts of smoke, don‚Äôt try to fight it yourself. The final rule is to always position yourself with an exit or means of escape at your back before you attempt to use an extinguisher to put out a fire.

56

CO2

H2O

Dry

üìù Notes:
Say:
There are three types of fire extinguishers: water, carbon dioxide and dry chemical. Water fire extinguishers are used for Class A fires or the fires that are fuelled by wood or paper.
Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers are most effective for controlling Class B and Class C fires. The fire extinguisher is effective only from a distance of three to eight feet. While using the extinguisher, remember to continue to apply the agent even after the fire has died out as the fire could re-ignite once the gas dispels.
Dry chemical fire extinguishers are used on oils and flammable liquids, but have multipurpose uses.

First Aid

Immediate medical assistance given to an injured or a sick person until an ambulance or a qualified medical professional arrives

Knowing some simple treatments could save lives!

[[OCR Image Text: ‚Äòwww.shutterstock.com - 196494266]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
First aid refers to the immediate medical assistance given to an injured or a sick person. This assistance will be of great help until an ambulance or a qualified medical professional arrives to the spot. As front office associates, your main job responsibility is not to provide medical guidance or assistance to guests. However, you could be near a guest when he or she is in medical emergency. It is better if you know some simple treatments that could save an individual‚Äôs life.

Transition: 
We will now learn more about first aid. 

Instructions for this section:
This is the core instruction section of this session.
Use the PPT slides appropriately with the concepts that you cover.
Move the session with discussions, explanations and examples. 
Whenever you ask a question, organise a small discussion with the learners. Proceed to the Say after you have completed the discussion. Use at least 3 minutes for each discussion.
Keep the discussion open to all learners and encourage them to participate.
Be open to diverse views from the learners. 
Write the keywords that are closely associated with the content of this session from the discussions on the board.
Observe if the learners change their views or exhibit comprehension of the concepts at various points in the discussions.

Say: We will begin with the principles to follow when giving first aid. The principles help you know what actions to take and what actions to avoid while giving first aid. For this, I would like you to listen to a scenario. Assume that a guest entering the hotel suddenly holds his chest and collapses on the floor. The victim‚Äôs wife screams in fear. You rush to victim. You keep assuring the woman that you will get help. But she starts to shout at you saying the husband needs medical help. This time, you tell her to remain calm so that you can concentrate on the victim.
¬†
Ask:
What qualities did you see in this scenario? 
Note: Encourage the learners to tell all qualities they see in this scenario. 
¬†
Note: Click to view more contents on the slide.
Say:
It was good to know your observations. As first aid provider, you must act calmly and logically. You should take control of the situation and your actions. You must be able to speak gently but firmly to the victim or the people with him. You should also be kind when interacting with the victim. 
Let us continue with the scenario.
¬†
Note: Click to view more contents on the slide.
The victim talks to you in a weak voice. He says he feels acute pain in his chest and shoulder. While loosening his shirt and checking his breathing, you tell him you have handled such situations before. You tell the victim you are trying to make him comfortable. The victim asks if his condition is serious. You tell him it is not a problem anymore as you have called for a doctor. 
¬†
Ask:
What qualities did you see in this scenario? 
Note: Encourage the learners to tell all qualities they see in this scenario. 
¬†
Say:
Good observation. As first aid provider, you must build trust with the victim by talking to him while giving the initial treatment. You should explain what you are doing. If the victim asks questions, be honest and tell the answers that you know. If you do not know the answer, you could tell him you are not certain. At no point, you should give the victim misleading information.
Let us continue with the scenario.

Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation or CPR

Process of CPR involves enabling the victim to breathe and applying pressure on the chest

Breathing and active heart are important for a person to live

üìù Notes:
Say: Good. I will now teach an important first aid technique called the Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation or CPR. This technique is useful when you want to help a guest who is experiencing breathing trouble. Breathing is important for every human. It provides oxygen supply to our body, which is vital for the functioning of brain. The oxygen is carried all over the body by the blood that keeps circulating from head to toe and again to the top. The heart pumps blood and facilitates blood circulation. Therefore, breathing and active heart are important for a person to live. We will now learn about CPR.
¬†
The process of CPR involves enabling the victim to breathe and applying pressure on the chest. Assume that a person stops breathing. You must first check if his or her heart is still active. If the heart is working, you should begin the process of artificial respiration, which enables the victim to breathe. The CPR procedure recommends the ABC process of artificial respiration. A stands for airway, B stands for breathing and C stands for circulation.

HOS_S24

Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation or CPR

Remove the obstructing object from the victim‚Äôs mouth by using your index finger. 
Stretch the neck to open the airway. Place one hand under the nape of the victim, and the other hand on the forehead. 
Tilt the head backwards and lift the chin up gently without closing the mouth. 
Check if the breathing is restored. Go close to the victim‚Äôs mouth. Look, listen and feel his breathing for five seconds.

üìù Notes:
Say:
When a victim is unconscious, he may find it difficult to breathe. His airway could be blocked because the muscles in the throat and tongue lose control. When this happens, the tongue folds back and blocks the throat. There could also be some object stuck in his throat. You should clear the airway by following this process:
¬†
First, remove the obstructing object from the victim‚Äôs mouth by using your index finger. 
Next, stretch the neck to open the airway. Place one hand under the nape of the victim, and the other hand on the forehead. Tilt the head backwards and lift the chin up gently without closing the mouth. 
Finally, check if the breathing is restored. Go close to the victim‚Äôs mouth. Look, listen and feel his breathing for five seconds.

HOS_S24

Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation or CPR

Pinch and close the victim‚Äôs nostrils. 
Take a deep breath. Place your mouth around the victim‚Äôs mouth without any gap and quickly breathe into the victim‚Äôs mouth four times. Repeat this once every five seconds for a few times. 
Check the victim‚Äôs breathing indicated by the rise and fall of his chest.

Mouth-to-Mouth Resuscitation

Close the victim‚Äôs mouth.
Keep your mouth on the victim‚Äôs nose covering it fully and blow in. 
Open the victim‚Äôs mouth to let him breathe out the air. Repeat these steps for a few times.

Nose-to-Mouth Resuscitation

üìù Notes:
Say:
If the victim is still not breathing, you should proceed to the next step of artificial respiration. Check again if the victim‚Äôs heart is working by feeling the pulse. For this, place two fingertips on the victim‚Äôs Adam‚Äôs apple in the throat with his head tilted back. Slid your fingers on both sides towards the back of the neck until the victim‚Äôs Adam‚Äôs apple is placed between the gap of your two fingers. Now press your fingertips slightly and feel the carotid pulse in the neck. If you are able to feel the pulse, you should proceed to restore breathing of the victim. You can restore breathing in two ways ‚Äì mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and mouth-to-nose resuscitation. You can give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by following this process:
¬†
First, pinch and close the victim‚Äôs nostrils.
Take a deep breath. Place your mouth around the victim‚Äôs mouth without any gap and quickly breathe into the victim‚Äôs mouth four times. Repeat this once every five seconds for a few times.
Check the victim‚Äôs breathing indicated by the rise and fall of his chest.

If the victim is still not breathing, check if his head is tilted back properly. Ensure your mouth closes the victim‚Äôs mouth completely. Close the victim‚Äôs nostrils fully. Check if there is any more object or vomit or blood is blocking the victim‚Äôs airway.
¬†
Assume that the victim‚Äôs mouth is too injured to close tightly or that he has eaten harmful substance that you do not want to contact with your mouth. You can then choose to give mouth-to-nose resuscitation in the following process:
First, close the victim‚Äôs mouth.
Then, keep your mouth on the victim‚Äôs nose covering it fully and blow in. 
Open the victim‚Äôs mouth to let him breathe out the air. Repeat these steps for a few times.

Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation or CPR

Place the victim on a hard surface and kneel by his side.
Keep your palm on the breastbone near the heart. Rest your other palm above the first palm and interlock the fingers.
Keeping your elbows straight, lean forward and apply your full body weight on your palms. 
Repeat to give steady and smooth pressure on the victim‚Äôs chest. 
Relax for a few seconds but do not remove your hand in order to use the same part of the victim‚Äôs body. 
Repeat the steps.

[[OCR Image Text: n ¬ª 325364234]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
If the heart is not working, it may result in the death of the victim. To avoid this, you should begin the process of chest compression, which applies pressure on the chest of the victim and restores blood circulation. You can restore blood circulation by following this process:
¬†
Place the victim on a hard surface and kneel by his side.

Slide Number: 15
Ask: How many minutes do you think are required to perform this first-aid technique on a victim? 
Note: Encourage the learners to take a wild guess. After a minute of discussion, proceed to Say. Click to view more contents.
¬†
Say:
Perform this CPR procedure for one minute. Give mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose resuscitation for two times and 15 chest compressions. Give the resuscitation two more times if the carotid pulse is still absent. Do these two activities alternatively for a minute or until the victim is able to breathe again.  If you have another person helping in the first aid, one of you could give artificial respiration and the other could give chest compressions. 
¬†
If you conduct the CPR procedure for a minute, you should have made eight attempts of artificial respiration ‚Äì two attempts made four times ‚Äì and 60 chest compressions ‚Äì 15 compressions given four times.
¬†
You must then call a doctor or an ambulance. Remember, first aid provides only basic medical treatment. You must ensure that the victim is sent for a professional medical observation as soon as possible.

The Recovery Position

Keep the victim‚Äôs head, neck and back in a straight line. 
Remove the specs or coolers and the items in the pockets and turn the victim on his side. 
Kneel beside the victim, tilt his head back and lift the chin gently to open the airway.
Straighten the legs. Pick the hand closer to you and move it such that it is at the right angle to the body. Bend the right hand elbow and turn the palm to face up. 
Place the other hand against the victim‚Äôs cheek with the palm facing out. 
Pull the victim‚Äôs left knee up and make it stand on a flat foot on the ground. The hip and the knee should be at right angle.
Tilt the head backward to keep the airway open.
Call for an ambulance.

üìù Notes:
Say:
Sometimes the posture of the victim could be risky to his body parts or even his life. As you have not practised medicine, you would not know the right position in which the victim should be kept, particularly if he is unconscious. If a victim is unconscious, there are two risks involved ‚Äì his tongue may block the throat and he may inhale the fluids such as saliva or stomach acids. You can keep a victim in the recovery position by following these steps:
¬†
First, keep the victim‚Äôs head, neck and back in a straight line. 
Remove the specs or coolers and the items in the pockets and turn the victim on his side. 
Kneel beside the victim, tilt his head back and lift the chin gently to open the airway.
Straighten the legs. Pick the hand closer to you and move it such that it is at the right angle to the body. Let us assume that the victim‚Äôs right hand is closer to you. After stretching it, you should bend the right hand elbow and turn the palm to face up. 
Now place the left hand against the victim‚Äôs left cheek with the palm facing out. 
Pull the victim‚Äôs left knee up and make it stand on a flat foot on the ground. The hip and the knee should be at right angle.
Tilt the head backward to keep the airway open.
Check if all body parts remain as per the recommendation explained till now and then call for an ambulance.

Asphyxia

Identify the cause of suffocation and correct it
Remove the object in the victim‚Äôs nose or mouth
Check the victim‚Äôs breathing 
Provide artificial respiration

[[OCR Image Text: ‚Äòwww.shutterstock.com - 214271488]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
We will now learn how to treat some common health conditions with first aid. Remember to obtain professional medical help in each of these health conditions after providing the first aid.
¬†
Asphyxia may be caused when the victim inhales poisonous gas or is choking. The victim starts to feel suffocated. Identify the cause of suffocation and correct it. For example, you may have to turn off any leaking gas and open the windows to let in fresh air. You may have to remove the object in the victim‚Äôs nose or mouth. In either case, check the victim‚Äôs breathing and provide artificial respiration using mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose resuscitation.

Choking

Bend the victim and give a hard slap between the shoulder blades

Bend the victim forward over a table or chair with his chest and head hanging and give another hard slap on the same place

OR

Hold the child upside down and slap on the back

If the victim is a child

üìù Notes:
Say:
Choking occurs when the food or other item is caught in the victim‚Äôs windpipe. If a guest coughs violently and struggles to breathe, you should check if he is choking. Coughing generally clears what is blocking the windpipe. In case, coughing does not help, bend the victim and give a hard slap between the shoulder blades. If this does not clear the blockage, bend the victim forward over a table or chair with his chest and head hanging and give another hard slap on the same place. If the victim is a child, hold him upside down and slap on the back. If these steps do not solve the situation, call for medical help immediately.

Convulsion/Fits

Keep the child or baby warm by wrapping a blanket around or placing him in a warm tub

Teething baby or Child with high fever

Remove furniture or other objects near the shaking victim
Tie a handkerchief between the teeth 
Wait for the victim to return to normal state
Never let him on his own immediately

Epileptic Fit

üìù Notes:
Say:
Convulsions or fits occur in two states. 
A baby who is teething or a child with high fever is an easy victim for this condition. The child will hold his breath, become rigid and turns into purple on the face. At such times, you should keep the child or baby warm by wrapping a blanket around or placing him in a warm tub.  
Some convulsions may lead to the victim falling on the ground and shaking the limbs violently. This is called as epileptic fit. In this case, you should remove furniture or other objects near the shaking victim. Tie a handkerchief between the teeth so that the victim does not bite his tongue. 
Wait for the victim to return to normal state. Do not shake him in order to bring back his consciousness. The victim would most likely be in a dazed state. So never let him on his own immediately after he suffers convulsion.

üìù Notes:
Trainer‚Äôs Instruction ‚Äì Ice breaking session - Have the group stand in a circle. Start clapping. All the learners are to announce their names while clapping.
Start the first round of the game yourself. Clap slowly, then little fast. Alternate between slow and fast clapping. All the students in the circle matches the rhythm and then you 

say loudly, ‚ÄúHodge podge, hodge podge, hodge podge, hodge podge,‚Äù and then the first few words of the sentence.

The second person is to say the next word  or words to build the sentence and so on around the circle, with one word for each clap. If a player wants to end a sentence or insert punctuation like comma, they can do so.
When a sentence ends, the next player starts a new sentence. The goal is to create a story.
If a player makes a mistakes, in unable to say a word with the clap or says something illogical or grammatically incorrect, they have to start the next round again. This continues for 10 minutes. And then make them sit.
For example ‚Äì

That was a funny game. Completely hodge podged. In lay man language we may call it khich pich. Our lives maybe the same. Completely hodeg podge. But we somehow to try to make a lesson out of the hodge podge. It is up to us to make it organised and sensible.
We now know each other in this class and we have so much in common.  I ensure you that we will have lots of fun during this course of hospitality. I will try to make it more interesting than only academic for you all. We will all learn by doing the subject - inquiry based learning, i.e asking questions, as many as you want!
In order to gain maximum from this and the upcoming sessions, it is necessary that we leverage on this commonality and the team spirit and share and learn from each other. 

There are some basic guiding rules that we need to follow to ensure that we participate and gain from every session.

Listen carefully.
Ask questions. No question is silly. Ask anyway.
Make mistakes. Try something new! 
Be creative.
Raise your hand if you are leaving your seat.
Keep your hands and feet to yourself. 
Respect your classmates and your teacher.

As I said before let us have fun, understand the purpose of what we are learning, and most importantly, discover the glamorous world of hospitality and hotels.

How do you plan on using the information given to you during the course to improve  your future once you graduate from here?

Trainer‚Äôs instruction - 
Learners create their own job description before you begin the session and any information on subject being given to them. Learners are required to draw, paint, scribble anything that they would want to do or become by joining this industry.
For example ‚Äì
Learner ‚Äì I want to see movie stars in the hotel. I have heard they visit the hotel often.
I like talking to people, hence I took up this job.
I wanted to learn the professional way of putting make up. I hope to learn here.
The description in the yellow card can be silly. Acknowledge all of them. 
Volunteer 10 learners to read from their card once over.  After 10 of them ask if any else also wants to tell the other students about their hopes and wishes. If not then ask the learners to stick this golden ticket on the first page of the student handbook.
Proceed to say once this activity is over. Time the activity for 15 minutes.

Say:
It‚Äôs always interesting to see what people make note of ‚Äì something little we must have seen ever has a huge impact on us. It connects us emotionally and intellectually to our lives. I ask you to please put this golden ticket on the first page of you notebooks. This way, each time you open the book, you would connect to it emotionally with your golden ticket through out this course of hospitality.

Now we will see the goals and objectives of today‚Äôs session.

Say:
As I said before, Front office is one of the main structure of hospitality management. It is the face of the hotel. It is the interface between a hotel and its guests.  When a guest first arrives, he meets the front office staff and develops an image of the hotel, its services and standards.

But do you also know that front office is the last department that the guest meets before leaving the hotel.
The staffs in this department are knowledgeable of every detail of the hotel that may impact the guest‚Äôs requirements and needs. When a guest first arrives, he meets the front office staff and develops an image of the hotel, its services and standards.
It is also the last department that guests contacts while leaving the hotel.

A poor man‚Äôs richness ‚Äì A tale of hospitality

21

Once upon a time

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

üìù Notes:
Say : We will now look at a story of one such hospitality by a very poor man to a prince. 
Trainer‚Äôs instruction - Read the story emphasizing on the bolded words.

Once upon a time there was a prince who would wander around the streets of banaras  disguised as  beggars. One day he saw a big house and knocked on the door, asking for a place to stay. The wealthy resident replied "I don't run a hotel. There's an ashram nearby for wandering beggars.‚Äù He crossed another lighted home of a carpenter. Poor carpenter welcomed the prince in his humble hut and made him comfortable.
Prince again visited as official guests of the king. A wealthy man  named Gulcharan, approached them and said  ‚ÄúRaj kumar! I have the honor of hosting you during your stay.¬†I am very wealthy and have all the luxury in my house.‚Äù The prince went to meet the town king. Gulcharan went home for prince‚Äôs reception. The coachman arrived at Gulcharan‚Äôs house with the luggage. Gulcharan asked the coachman, "When is the prince going to come here?‚Äú The coachman replied ‚Äúhe is not coming. He will be staying at the carpenters home. He asked me  to get the horses and luggage to your house."
Gulcharan rushed to the carpenters hut and knocked  on the door. ‚ÄúRajkumar," he cried. Prince was having a cup of tea "Why have you done this to me? What I have done to deserve such humiliation!‚Äù The prince said "But you¬†are¬†hosting me, at least, that part of me that you desire to host. Last time I was here, without a coach, horses, coachman and bundles of pressed clothes, you turned me away from your door. So it is not¬†me you want in your home, but my coachman, horses and luggage ‚Äîwhich are currently enjoying your hospitality..."

Trainer‚Äôs note- 
Explain the importance of care, empathy, humbleness, modesty and positive attitude at the end of the story to explain hospitality. Also mention the effects of rude behavior in hospitality.

After the story is over,
Say: we notice that hospitality is a way of attitude and behavior of each individual. With this attitude a large organization like a hotel functions effectively. Now lets know about hotels.

What Does Hotel Mean To You?

Raghubalan and Smritee Raghubalan define hotels

‚ÄúA hotel may be defined as a place that offers accommodation, food and beverages at a cost that enables it to make profit.‚Äù
(Hotel Housekeeping, 2009)

Concise Oxford Dictionary defines hotels

house for accommodation of paying travellers, etc.

The Webster‚Äôs Dictionary defines hotels

‚Äòa building or institution providing lodging, meals and services for the people‚Äô

A hotel needs to provide boarding and restaurant services to guests as well as make profits in the business.

üìù Notes:
Ask: So now lets point out the facilities in a hotel. Can anyone enlist a few services provided by a hotel?
¬†
Possible Answers:
Hotels are places where we can stay safely and buy food.
Hotels provide rooms on rent for days or even weeks. 
No, I haven‚Äôt stayed in a hotel.
¬†

Say: Good! I agree with your answers.
Trainer‚Äôs instruction ‚Äì Read the definitions from the slide.
After that say - I think the Raghubalans have captured the main purposes of running the hotel business in one sentence effectively. Let us analyse this definition now. 
¬†
Note: The keywords discussed in these paragraphs are given in bold yellow font on the slide. Point them when speaking.
¬†
Notice that all three definitions mention stay and food as two characteristics of hotels. This is from the viewpoint of the guests who stay in the hotel. 
¬†
However, the Raghubalans have gone a step further to include the aspect of making profit, which is crucial from the viewpoint of hotel owners. Without profit, the management cannot support the staff and offer the amenities to the guests, right? The functioning of hotels depends largely on the profits earned by the management. Therefore, a hotel needs to provide boarding and restaurant services to guests as well as make profits in the business.

What was the starting point for hotels?

When Did It Start?

24

People travelled extensively in search of knowledge, for medicines, new regions, survival or business. 
A simple journey took many days.
People had to take rest and eat before they continued on their journeys.

People also travelled to visit various places in search for culture and spiritualism. 
Temples, mosques, churches  and monasteries provided accommodation for pilgrims

Sarais and Dharmashalas were built in 340 BC

TRAVEL AND PILGRIMAGE

üìù Notes:
So now you know that hotel industry is part of hospitality sector. Let us learn about evolution of hotels in India.

Instructions:
This row covers the first objective ‚Äì Introduce hotels and their evolution in India.
¬†
Ask: Today, many hotels in India make a good profit every year. But what was the starting point for hotels? I will give you a clue. It was a habit among people in ancient times that led to forming hotels. Can you guess that habit? 
 
Possible Answers:
People did not know how to cook. 
People travelled a lot and wanted places on the route to eat and sleep.
¬†
Note: Click to view contents on the slide.
Say: Those were interesting answers from all of you. I would say that the travelling habit among people led to forming of hotels. In ancient times, people travelled quite often. They travelled to enhance their knowledge, for medicine, explore new regions, find a living or for business. As there were no transportation facilities, a simple journey took many days. This raised the need for places on the route to eat and take rest before the people continued on their journey. People always need food, drink and somewhere to sleep, don't they?

Ancient Indian Philosophy and Hotels

25

[[OCR Image Text: K(- Incredible India!

Sa

Atithi Devo Bhava means ‚ÄúGuest is God‚Äù]]

üìù Notes:
Say: According to ancient Indian philosophy, ‚ÄúAtithi devo bhava‚Äù is followed, which means any guest is to be accorded the status of god. There was also a connection between religion, travelling and public accommodations. Our country has practised many cultures and spiritualism for centuries. People went for pilgrimages frequently. Irrespective of the religion, there are many pilgrims travelling to different places of worship. Temples, mosques, churches and monasteries in our country took care of such pilgrims by providing them accommodation and food. 
During Mogul rule, the forts & their surroundings would cater to the needs of the traveller often in exchange for no more than the story of their adventures and valour. You all must have heard about Ellora caves, they were made for providing a place to stay to the Buddhist monks who travelled from Sri Lanka to North for pilgrimage. In fact, you will be surprised to know that Chandragupta Maurya, the Indian emperor who was born in 340 BC, built inns and guesthouses. He called them sarais and dharmashalas. Can you believe that we recognised the need for public accommodation in the era of kings and empires? Amazing, isn‚Äôt it? 
¬†
So it was only natural that this practice of building boarding houses continued when the British ruled our country. They built circuit houses and dak banglas for taking rest when they travelled.

Railway Hotels

The railways first opened retiring rooms for cotton traders coming to Mumbai, known as the RAILWAY HOTEL

Bhavans

Hotels were earlier known as BHAVANS

Thinnais

In Tamil, THINNAI refers to an elevated veranda attached to the front of houses. They were the first inns to provide accommodation to travellers.

[[OCR Image Text: Hi var]]

[[OCR Image Text: hss]]

üìù Notes:
Explanation of the chits ‚Äì 
The first term is thinnai. These refer to the inns first opened at private homes to offer accommodation to travellers. In Tamil, thinnai refers to an elevated veranda attached to the front of houses to provide resting place for travellers. Houses with thinnai are still a common sight in villages in Tamil Nadu. 
¬†
The second term is bhavans. Well, until a few decades ago people used to call hotels as bhavans. The name ‚Äòhotel‚Äô became popular only recently. 
¬†
The third term is Railway Hotels. The railways first opened retiring rooms for cotton traders coming to Mumbai. They named it Railway Hotels. These words give you a glimpse of how hospitality evolved in our country, don‚Äôt they?

Early Commercial Hotels in India

The Taj Mahal Hotel (1903)

Transportation facilities improved

People started to travel more

More public accommodation needed

Businessmen invested more on hotels

Image Source: Outlook India

üìù Notes:
Say: Even before independence, we built our first commercial hotel. The Taj Mahal Palace was built in Mumbai in 1903. 
¬†
Note: Click to view the contents.
Say: As transportation facilities improved through air, water and land, people started to travel a lot. This resulted in a need for more inns, motels, hotels and resorts at various points in every city. Businessmen saw lot of opportunities in the hotel industry and, thus the number of hotels grew rapidly. 

As per the report from the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India, there are 1376 hotels and 76567 hotel rooms all over our country registered with the government. This is definitely a lesser figure compared to the actual count because many accommodation houses operate merely as family businesses for generations. They do not see the need for registering with the government. However, even such places have front office teams.

Criteria to Classify Hotels

Location

Target Market

Property Size

Service Level

Length of Stay

Theme

Cost of rooms

Ownership

üìù Notes:
Note-
This row covers the second objective ‚Äì Classify the hotels based on six criteria.
¬†
Say:  Now you may have a doubt here. It is supposed that there are 1376 hotels in our country. I have seen many hotels in our city. Some hotels are big and some are small. Do you think that we have specific numbers based on the size of hotels?‚Äù
¬†
Elicit answers from the learners. The answers may be yes, no, random figure or they may not know. Pause and proceed to say.

Note: Click on the slide to view the contents.
Say: There are numerous hotels in this country. You can classify hotels based on the following criteria: location, target market, size of property, level of service, length of stay and theme. However, no list of classification is complete as this industry is diverse. You can classify a hotel based on two or more criteria. There could also be more criteria such as ‚Äòcost of rooms‚Äô and ‚Äòownership‚Äô added to the classification. Nevertheless, in today‚Äôs class, I will explain the hotel industry based on these six criteria.

Activity 4 ‚Äì Criterion: Location

Listen to the descriptions I read and walk to the correct placard
Match the name of the hotel to its location.

[[OCR Image Text: =~ ‚Äî.
‚Äòwww.shutterstock.com - 272295182]]

üìù Notes:
Say: Hotels can be classified based on their locations. City hotels, suburban hotels, motels, airport hotels, resort hotels and forest hotels fall in this category. We will have an activity to learn about these hotels. For this, I need six volunteers. 
¬†
Note: Select six volunteers. Give each volunteer one word from the location category. Ask them to write that word in a placard in big letters and hold it up to the class. While they keep showing the placards, you will read out the following descriptions one by one. After you read a description, one or two learners seated in the class should walk to the volunteer that has the correct category name and stand there until the end of the activity. He/she cannot participate for the remaining descriptions. If a learner does not walk to the correct placard, send him/her back to the seat.
¬†
Say: Now I am going to read small descriptions about city hotels, suburban hotels, motels, airport hotels, resort hotels and forest hotels. Listen to the descriptions carefully. After I read a description, the learners who guessed about what hotel I just read should walk to the learner holding that category name. For example, if you think my description relates to forest hotels, you should walk to the learner who has the placard that reads ‚ÄòForest Hotels‚Äô. 
 
I would like only one or two of you to walk to the placards. Once you have walked to the correct placard, you do not have to participate further. It will be the turn for the remaining learners. If you want to participate in this activity, you have to be quick in responding to my descriptions. Are you ready?

¬†These hotels are located in quiet surroundings near to the cities. (Suburban hotels)
¬†These hotels provide basic facilities to highway travellers. (Motels)
¬†These hotels cater to tourists visiting forest areas. (Forest hotels)

Location ‚Äì Types of Hotels (Recap)

üìù Notes:
Say: That was an excellent effort from all of you. Please get back to your places and I will summarise about each type of location hotels.
The city hotels are located in the heart of the city. They are close to famous shopping areas, public buildings, business centres and other entertainment zones in the city. The rooms in these hotels are usually expensive owing to the proximity and connectivity to many tourist spots. City hotels are also called as downtown hotels. 
¬†
The suburban hotels are located in suburbs or the outskirts of the city. They give an advantage of quieter surroundings than city hotels. The room rents are cheaper and suitable for budget travellers. 
¬†
Motels are usually located on highways. The word motel is derived from the term ‚Äòmotor hotels‚Äô. These hotels are ideal choice for tourists travelling by road. People usually rent motels for overnight stay and vacate in the morning to continue with their travel. To attract more road travellers, these hotels provide huge parking space and have petrol stations nearby.  
 
Forest hotels are situated in or near forests or reserved forests or national parks. These hotels are especially for tourists who visit the forests for adventure. 
¬†
Airport hotels are located near airports. These hotels are useful for travellers in transit, that is, who have to wait for many hours to take the next flight. 
¬†
Resort hotels are located in hill stations, near seashores, close to valleys or lakes where guests can be close to natural surroundings. These hotels allow guests to relax and spend leisure time as a change from their hectic lives. There are many types of resort hotels including health resorts, hill resorts, beach resorts, summer resorts and winter resorts. The room rates of these hotels differ according to the season and occupancy.

Target Market ‚Äì Types of Hotels

üìù Notes:
Say: The second criterion for hotel classification is target market. Many hotels cater to a specific group of guests.  The types of hotels in this category include commercial hotels, convention hotels, suite hotels, bed and breakfast or B and B hotels, casino hotels, timeshares and service apartments.  I will explain these hotel types now. 

Instructions:
This content is covered in multiple slides. Move to the relevant slide when you describe a hotel.

Constructed in European architecture and design
Have large meeting centres to host conventions, conference, national meetings, exhibitions

üìù Notes:
Commercial hotels and convention hotels cater to corporate community. Commercial hotels target business people. These hotels are built in commercial areas of the city. They are mostly constructed in European architecture and design. Convention hotels have large meeting centres in which organisations can host conventions, conferences, national meetings, and exhibitions.

Service apartments

Target professionals such as lawyers and business executives  to give home-away-from-home experience

üìù Notes:
The next type of target-based hotel is the suite hotels. The rooms in suite hotels consist of small kitchens equipped with utensils, refrigerator, oven and a bar. These hotels target professionals such as lawyers and business executives who have to stay for a longer period in their travel. The aim of suite hotels is to give a home-away-from-home experience for the guests. Therefore, room services are limited in these hotels. These days, many conventional hotels have an area allocated for suite rooms.

36

Criterion: Target Market

Suite hotels

B&B hotels

Casino hotels

Timeshares

Service apartments

Bed and breakfast hotels maintained by individual home owners
Limited services and cheaper rent

üìù Notes:
A B&B hotel is bed-and-breakfast hotel that could be a big house converted into public accommodation facility or a small commercial building with around 30 guestrooms. The owners of B&B hotels live in the same premise and, as the name implies, provide breakfast to the guests. These hotels do not offer other services such as laundry, lunch and dinner, recreational facilities and meeting rooms. Thus, they are cheaper than a full-service hotel.

Prioritise on the gambling facilities

üìù Notes:
Casino hotels target leisure and vacation travellers who love to gamble. These hotels provide common hotel services such as stay and food. However, they prioritise on the gambling facilities operating in the hotel premises. Some hotels have gambling unit open 24 hours on all days of the year. You will be surprised to know that profits for casino hotels are more from the gambling units than other services.

Timeshares

Service apartments

For individuals or businesses that want to own the property for a specific period

üìù Notes:
The next type of target-based hotels is the timeshares. This is a unique concept of hotel in which individuals purchase the accommodation facilities for a specific period, say, a few weeks or months. They will be the owners for that period and occupy the facility. Sometimes, these temporary owners rent out the facilities. Club Mahindra holiday resorts are timeshare accommodations. The club buys the facilities from some owners and provide the rooms for travellers of the club.

Service apartments

For business executives and corporate trainers who travel frequently

üìù Notes:
The last type of target-based hotels is the service apartments. These accommodations do not appear like a commercial hotel. People who want to stay in a place for longer periods for a considerable rent will choose service apartments. Business executives who travel quite often in their jobs and corporate trainers are some of the target groups for service apartments. These apartments are also called as corporate lodgings.

Say: The third criterion for classifying hotels is the size of the property.  The number of rooms in a hotel determines its capacity or size. We will learn to categorise hotels by size through an activity. I want six volunteers for this activity. 
¬†
Note: Prepare six placards that has these names on each ‚ÄòSmall hotels‚Äô, ‚ÄòMedium hotels‚Äô, ‚ÄòLarge hotels‚Äô, ‚ÄòVery large hotels‚Äô, ‚ÄòMega hotels‚Äô and ‚ÄòChain hotels‚Äô. Give these placards to the volunteers and make them stand in front of the class. Write these words in small pieces of chart papers ‚Äì ‚Äò25 rooms‚Äô, ‚Äò26-100 rooms‚Äô,‚Äô 101-300 rooms‚Äô,‚Äô more than 300 rooms‚Äô, ‚Äòmore than 1000 rooms‚Äô and ‚Äòhotels in many locations‚Äô. Keep these chart pieces with you. Read out these sentences one by one and ask the remaining learners to guess the hotel. Give them a minute to guess the correct answer. The order of the hotels is mixed deliberately, so allow the learners to change their previous answers, if required.

üìù Notes:
Say: hp-pc	2/26/2018
Let us assume there are 4 friends and they have got jobs in hotel and they are Deepa, Shyam, Varun and Meghna. I will explain the hotels they work for. Listen carefully and just guess the hotel type from the placard. Do not worry. You can change your choice anytime.

CLICK ONCE FOR QUESTIONS.

Varun works in a hotel that has 450 rooms. What type of hotel will that be? Choose from the placards. (Very large hotel)
¬†
Note: Give the chart paper ‚Äòmore than 300 rooms‚Äô to the volunteer whom majority of the class points at. The volunteer should display the chart piece along with the placard so that the learners can review their choices all the time. Do this after every description and change the chart pieces if the learners want to. The answers are given in the bracket next to the questions.
¬†
Next, Deepa works in a hotel that has 25 rooms. What type of hotel that will be? (Small hotel)
Note: Give the chart piece ‚Äô25 rooms‚Äô to the volunteer whom majority of the class points at.
¬†
Shyam works in a hotel that has 225 rooms. What type of hotel that will be? (Large hotel)
Note: Give the chart piece ‚Äô101-300 rooms‚Äô to the volunteer whom majority of the class points at.

Note: Give the chart piece ‚Äômore than 1000 rooms‚Äô to the volunteer whom majority of the class points at.
¬†
CLICK ONCE TO REVEAL THE ANSWERS
Good job! Now lets see the answers.
I will now sum up the category of hotels based on the property or room size. Small hotels have 25 rooms or less. Medium-sized hotels have 26 to 100 rooms. Large hotels have 101 to 300 rooms. Very large hotels have more than 300 rooms. Mega hotels have over 1000 rooms. Finally, when a hotel has many units in the country, it is called chain hotels.

Criterion: Level of Service

43

üìù Notes:
Say: The fourth criterion to classify a hotel is the level of service it provides. There are three levels of service ‚Äì economy, mid-scale and luxury hotels. 
¬†
Economy hotels offer the basic facilities to the guests. The rooms will be clean, simple and inexpensive. Budget-travellers and travellers who do not like luxurious facilities prefer such hotels. 
¬†
Mid-scale hotels offer modest services but better than economy hotels. Their staff count is also greater than the staff count of economy hotels. Statistics show that a large percentage of travellers prefer hotels that provide this level of service. 
¬†
Luxury hotels offer the highest quality and level of services. These hotels comprise exquisite lounges and restaurants, breath-taking decor, dedicated staff to carry luggage and handle letters for the guests ‚Äì also known as concierge services ‚Äì and meeting rooms. They replace bath linen twice a day and provide turndown service every evening. The properties used in the guestrooms are expensive and sophisticated.

Criterion: Length of Stay

Duration up to which guests can stay

Transient hotels

Residential hotels

Semi-residential hotels

For guests who want to stay one day or less
Found near airports and seaports

For guests who want to stay minimum of one month and maximum of two years
Guests pay monthly or quarterly rent

Provide selected services of both transient and residential types of hotels

üìù Notes:
Say: The next criterion for classifying hotels is the duration up to which guests can stay. There are three types of classifications ‚Äì transient hotels, residential hotels and semi-residential hotels. 
¬†
Note: Click to show the content on the slide. 
Say: Suppose a guest needs to stay in a hotel for a day or less, he can choose transient hotels. Such hotels are common near airports and seaports. As guests to these hotels have tight work schedules, these hotels have travel agents and car rental services too. These hotels are in high demand; one room may be rented out more than once in a day! Therefore, the role of front office department in these hotels is huge. They will have much work to do within a short span of time. 
¬†
Note: Click to show the content on the slide.
Say: Residential hotels are suitable for guests who wish to stay for a minimum of one month to a maximum of two years. The hotel management signs a lease agreement with the guests. The guests pay the rent either monthly or quarterly. Such hotels consist of a sitting room, a bedroom, a washroom, and a small kitchen.  
¬†
Note: Click to show the content on the slide.
Say: Semi-residential hotels provide selected services from both transient and residential types of hotels. For example, a semi-residential hotel could allocate guests for short stay in one part of the hotel and long stay in the other part.

Criterion: Theme

Heritage hotels

Ecotels

Boutique hotels

Spas

Converted forts, palaces and mansions 
Traditional food served
Folk dance and other activities of heritage India

Environment-sensitive hotels
Conscious not to disturb the environment unnecessarily

Exceptional accommodation in stylish settings
Personalised services and luxurious facilities

Provide medicinal baths and massages along with other comfortable services

üìù Notes:
The questions are given to encourage active learning.
Give around 1 minute for discussing after each question.

Say: The last criterion for classifying a hotel is the theme it chooses to define itself. You can probably notice the theme in the architecture of the hotel building, the properties used inside, the facilities or services offered or any other distinctive feature. There are four types of hotels in this category ‚Äì heritage hotels, ecotels, boutique hotels and spas. The theme of a hotel is quite evident in its name. Let us have a small discussion here.

Ask: What comes to your mind when you think of the word ‚Äòheritage hotels‚Äô? 
¬†
Note: Invite learners‚Äô views and encourage them to answer even if they are not certain. You could help them to complete an answer. 
¬†
Possible Answers:
The hotel design will be of ancient style.
They will serve only Indian traditional food.
The staff will be dressed in traditional formal dresses.
¬†
Note: Click to view text on the slide.
Say: Thank you for your answers. Like many of you said, heritage hotels reflect the unique culture of India. In fact, these hotels were once forts, palaces and mansions of aristocratic or royal families of princely states that existed before independence. Every room in these hotels have a history. The food they serve are very traditional in taste, and the recipe is sometimes modified to cater to specific needs of customers from India and abroad. The management organises folk dances and other activities that showcase the rich Indian culture. They should also have one or more sporting facility. Such as swimming pool, health club, lawn tennis, squash, riding, golf course.
There are three types of heritage hotels ‚Äì Heritage, Heritage classic and Heritage grand.
Heritage Hotels: This category cover existing and running hotels in palaces/castles/forts/havelies/hunting loges/ residence of any size built prior to 1950. The facade, architectural features and general construction should have the distinctive qualities and ambience in keeping with the traditional way of life of the area. The hotel should have a minimum of 5 rooms (10 beds). 
Heritage Classic and Heritage Grand: This category will cover hotels in residences/havelies/hunting lodges/castles/forts/ palaces built Prior to 1935. The hotel should have a minimum of 15 room (30 beds). 
In the category of Heritage grand however all public and private areas including rooms should have superior appearance and decor. At least 50% of the rooms should be air-conditioned (except in hill stations where there should be heating arrangements).


Now, we will learn about ecotels.
¬†
Ask: What do you know about ecotels? I will give a clue. It is related to the environment. 
¬†
Possible Answers:
These hotels are environment friendly.
These hotels will not harm the environment unless it is essential.
¬†
Note: Click to view text on the slide.
Say:
Good try. Ecotels are environment-sensitive hotels. These hotels will be conscious to not disturb the natural environment unnecessarily. However, in reality, there may be some unavoidable damage as it is impossible to run a business otherwise. For example, each guestroom may have a few plastic bottles and papers in their trashcan every day. That trash needs to be disposed of judiciously. Hotels cannot avoid this as guests would want to have the trashcan emptied every day. 
¬†
Note: Click to view text on the slide.
Say:
We will now look at boutique hotels. Boutique hotels provide exceptional accommodation in stylish settings. These hotels offer personalised services and luxurious facilities while maintaining customer privacy. These hotels cater to the rich and the famous.
¬†
Note: Click to view text on the slide.
Say:
Another type of theme hotels is ‚Äòspa‚Äô. Spa is the name of a mineral spring in Belgium. When beauty salons and massage centres started to offer medicinal or mineral bath and massages, they called the service ‚Äòspa‚Äô. Slowly, spa hotels came into being. These hotels also provide medicinal baths and massages along with other comfortable services. They appoint healthcare professionals to supervise the spa services of the hotel.

Star Ratings for Hotels

The Hotel and Restaurant Approval Classification Committee (HRACC)

üìù Notes:
Say: Now we will learn about ratings of hotels. These ratings are popular identification for all hotels and they come with stars. 
¬†
Ask: Can you guess what ratings I am talking about now? 
¬†
Possible Answers:
First class, second class
High class, low class
Five star, four star 
¬†
Note: Guide the learners‚Äô answers to the star ratings of the hotel. 
Then, click on the slide to view the contents.
¬†
Say: Good. Our hotel industry follows a star rating system namely one-star, two-star, three-star, four-star and five-star. This rating indicates the number and standard of facilities provided by the hotels. The Hotel and Restaurant Approval Classification Committee or HRACC, which comprises of select government and industry members, review the hotels against some criteria of standards and certifies each with a suitable rating.

Star or popularity??

Assume that Varun now works in a five-star hotel in Mumbai. He gets a job in a two-star hotel in Dubai. Though he is excited to work abroad, he is little hesitant to move to a hotel with a lower star rating. What will you suggest Varun to do?

Ask him to take the job as Dubai is a popular tourist country and he can grow

Ask him to remain in the five-star hotel in India as it has a higher rating

YES! THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL STAR RATING SYSTEM FOR HOTELS.

üìù Notes:
Ask: Assume that Varun now works in a five-star hotel in Mumbai. He gets a job in a two-star hotel in Dubai. Though he is excited to work abroad, he is little hesitant to move to a hotel with a lower star rating. What will you suggest Varun to do?
¬†
Possible Answers:
Ask him to take the job as Dubai is a popular tourist country and he can grow
Ask him to remain in the five-star hotel in India as it has a higher rating
¬†
Say: Thank you for sharing your suggestions. Though the star ratings of the hotels are different, you cannot compare them as they are in different countries. Yes! There is no universal star rating system for hotels. Other countries could follow a different set of criteria ‚Äì higher or lower than Indian criteria ‚Äì for rating their hotels. Moreover, the star ratings have become a little unorganised these days. Some hotels claim to be even seven-star in India. One of the reasons for this is the entry of foreign chains of hotels in our country. The committee is working towards resetting the criteria for ratings to match with the sophisticated and latest services offered by the foreign chain of hotels. Now, I will explain the services of Indian hotels according to the star ratings.

üìù Notes:
One-star hotels are small and family-owned hotels. Here, the owner and the family members provide the services. The hotels operate under informal conditions and provide limited services. For example, the employees may not appear in uniform or there may be no laundry and wakeup call services. The food and rooms will be simple. Some bedrooms may not have a bath attached. However, the maintenance and cleanliness of the hotels must meet the acceptable standards.

Spacious reception and other public areas

guestrooms equipped with hair dryer, direct-dial telephone and toiletries

Better stay experience for the guests

Special services for business travellers

Three-star Hotels

üìù Notes:
The size and services of three-star hotels are one step above two-star hotels. The reception and other public areas in three-star hotels will be spacious. The guestrooms will be equipped with hair dryer, direct-dial telephone and toiletries in the bathroom to provide a better experience for the guests. Apart from the usual room services, some three-star hotels provide special services for business travellers.

The furniture and fittings in these hotels are selected carefully to create an attractive decor. There will be more staff in these hotels to cater to different types of guest services including laundry, porter service and room service. The restaurants will provide international cuisine along with the Indian cuisine.

The interiors and exteriors of the hotel will be attractive and artistic. The service will be formal, organised and provided with utmost attention to all guests. All employees will be qualified in hospitality and customer care. The restaurant will definitely have international cuisine in its menu.

üìù Notes:
More probable answers must be in favour of Yellow book. 

The most possible answers must be :
Because it looks attractive, the colour is interesting and bright. The text is funny sounding.

Say: On opening the book, we see that the text and content inside the book also looks and sounds interesting.
The cover of the book alone gives us the first impression of the content of the book. The cover acts as an interface between the reader and the book. If the cover is attractive and appealing, most readers would definitely open it and read it once. On the contrary if the cover is boring and uninteresting, the readers would not give a chance for the content of the book to form an impression. Readers will simply just skip to another book.

Before moving to the main point ask the learners if they can relate this to their role in the hotel, allow them to think and develop this analogy themselves and them move on to saying this. Keep this discussion for 5 minutes.

Ask: Can you relate this point to your role in the hotel?

üìù Notes:
Say: Lets define Front Office Department. We have already established that it is the basis to form impression of the entire hotel.

As per Shri Jatashankar R. Tewari, in his book of HOTEL FRONT OFFICE ‚Äì OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT, Front office is mentioned as ‚ÄúThe interface between a hotel and its guests. It is the first department of the hotel with which guests come in contact at the time of their arrival and is also the last department they interact with when they depart from the hotel.‚Äù Front office helps people decide to whether to choose¬†the hotel or not - winning or¬†losing a prospective customer.

We will have small play here.

Instructions:
Conduct a role play here to give them the clear picture of front office and how it is important and creates the first impression. Ask one of the FOA to be very polite and courteous as per his/her knowledge of front office, handle the guest. Ask the other one to be rude, inattentive, irritable.
Call 4 volunteers and make 2 pairs, one person will act as front office associate and one as guest.
Allow 15 minutes for preparation and 10 minutes of presentation to each pair.

After the play is over, applaud the participants.

Say: That was an interesting play. Let me debrief the activity here for you.
We saw on the arrival at a hotel, guest first meet the front office associate and thinks of four main attributes ‚Äì Services, Standards, Facilities and the Hospitality of the hotel. The questions in the minds guest need prompt response from the front office team. The rude and inattentive behavior will definitely result in loss of customer or a bad review on social media. 
A good and approachable response will give a beneficial success rate in repeat customer.

Hierarchy ‚Äì Front Office

HOS_S07

Criteria:
Division of labour ‚Äì everyone specializes in one particular task.
Span of control ‚Äì number of people reporting to one supervisor.

[[OCR Image Text: wwwshutterstock.com - 142746613]]

üìù Notes:
Organization structure or Hierarchy is a structure formed with all the job positions or titles present in the department.
It shows the level of authority and responsibility of each person in the department. The heads of all the sections come under the department head and the lower grade employees are placed at the bottom of the hierarchy. There are numerous hotels in our country. Each hotel has a different hierarchy for the front office department. 

Ask: Can you guess the reason for different hierarchies for the same department?
¬†
Possible Answers:
There could be different number of sections in each hotel.
There could be many employees in the department.
¬†
Say: That was a good effort. I will explain. There cannot be one hierarchy for all hotels simply because the size of the hotels or the type of services they offer may vary. There are big, medium and small hotels in our country. We cannot have a small hierarchy with just one head and 10 employees for a big hotel, can we? Therefore, hotels choose a hierarchy that is appropriate to their size, rating or type. 

In front office department it is built upon the following criteria:
Division of labour ‚Äì everyone specialises in one particular task.
Span of control ‚Äì number of people reporting to one supervisor.
These two criteria help forming a hierarchical structure for a big or small organisation. A hotel also chooses hierarchy based on its size or type of services provided. 

If you face any trouble in your job or have a doubt in your duties, you need to clear it with the help of your colleague or superior. You will be able to do this only if you know job positions and roles of the members in relation to each other. It is important to be aware of your job responsibilities and  communicate any problem through an appropriate channel.When a department is organised, it is possible to group the tasks logically, delegate or assign responsibilities and carry out all internal activities smoothly. In an organised department, every employee has only one supervisor, as conflicting directions from many supervisors will create confusion in the department.

Front Office organization ‚Äì Small Hotel

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Explain the chart to the learners.
Point at the appropriate roles when stating them.
This row covers the second objective ‚Äì Identify the front office department structure in the hotels.
 
Say: Hierarchical structure is made simple when represented in an organisational chart.  An organisational chart provides a clear picture of the lines of authority and channels within the department. It is a diagram that shows who heads the department, who leads the teams and who works under different supervisors. It shows the functional relationship between the members of the department. 

In a small hotel, we can see very few people constitute the department.
Everyone has clear job responsibilities. Each one specializes in one particular task. This prevents overlapping and confusion in delegation of work.
In this kind of structure, the reception performs the functions of reservation and information desk as well. 
Bell captain performs the duties of concierge and travel desk.

Note that the organisation charts we see in this session are representational and do not show the complete structure. Hotels could add or remove roles in the structure based on their requirements.

They begin to look for an accommodation which is within their budget and near to the airport. They find one hotel and phone them to present their enquiries. 
The call is answered by a very professional and crisp sounding associate on the other side who happily answers all the questions of the sisters. Post the conversation, the sisters and the hotel associate make an itinerary of the trip. 

Trainer‚Äôs instructions ‚Äì 
Choose three learners to enact the following scene.
2 of them will act like sisters(potential guest). The other one will be the telephone operator.
They have to act on the following scene.
Narrate the scene on a medium pace. Help the learners if they lose track of the goal of the play-  to engage in conversation with the telephone operator.
Keep the play for 10 minutes. Conclude with appreciation.

Conclude the play - Say
Wow, brilliant play!!
This associate (say the name of the learner) who spoke and answered the phone is the first person to get in contact with the guest (the sisters). He/she has become the ambassador of the hotel and is responsible to create an impression of the hotel and its services to the sisters, even before the beginning of their travel. This associate alone  is representation of the complete front office department.

Lets discuss a little more about the role of all the departments with Front office.
We shall begin with Housekeeping.
Now who would like a dirty room?
No one!! Right.
When a guest checks-in would want a spick and shining room. Only through proper channel of communication from the front desk, the house keeping department can prepare the room before the arrival of the guest.
House keeping makes and share the following information on a report with Front office which is then tallied in their system:Room status ‚Äì Occupied, Do not disturb, Vacant, Sleepers(A room from which a guest has checked out but it is showing as occupied in the front office room status).
Exact house count (House count- exact number of the guests staying in the hotel).
Extra person in any room.
Coordinate in guest room change.

SECURITY CONCERNS - House keeping notifies Front office in any unusual circumstances ‚Äì theft, violation of hotel security, open fire exit.
Guests special request ‚Äì House keeping places special requests items on instruction from Front office. Such as extra linen, toiletries, amenities, flowers iron, oil, Odd cupboard items(Items usually not placed in room amenities but may be asked for by the guest)

Room Discrepancies occur when there is a conflict between the Front Desk and Housekeeping occupancy status of a room.
There are two types of Room Discrepancies,¬†Sleep¬†and¬†Skip. The report generated is called the discrepancy report.
Sleep Discrepant¬†- This occurs when the Front Desk room status shows a room as ‚ÄòVacant‚Äô, but the Housekeeping room status is marked as ‚ÄòOccupied‚Äô. ¬†A common way this can happen is when a guest comes down to the Front Desk to settle their bill, but is not actually checking-out at that time. After settlement, the guest returns to the room. If the Front Desk agent mistakenly checked the room out, and Housekeeping then enters the room, they may change the Housekeeping status back to ‚ÄòOccupied‚Äô until the guest physically departs.

Skip Discrepant -¬†This occurs when the Front Desk room status shows a room as ‚ÄòOccupied‚Äô, but the Housekeeping room status is marked as ‚ÄòVacant‚Äô. ¬†The most common way this can happen is when a guest may leave on the morning of departure without stopping by the Front Desk to check-out. In properties where payment is taken in full at check-in, or an advance check-out folio is delivered over night before departure, guests with no additional charges to pay, or those with credit cards on file may simply leave the keys in the room and depart. ¬†Housekeeping may come in to clean the room and mark it as ‚ÄòVacant‚Äô, while the Front Desk still has the reservation checked-in.
In both situations, the Discrepancy Report indicates issues with the occupancy status of a room, and should be printed and given to the Front Desk to follow up

Instruction:
Case study ‚Äì Read the scenario.
After reading out the scenario, explain in your own words or add more dimensions to it to ensure everybody understands.
Encourage all learners to share their opinion. Proceed to Say after a small discussion for questions.
¬†
Say: Assume that you are standing in a bus stop on one evening. You had helped your friend to paint his house in the morning. Your dress is wrinkled, your shoes are dirty, your hair is ruffled up and your hands are greasy. You look tired and badly need a bath.
At that time, a man walks near you. He seems to have lost his way and looks for help from someone. Just then, he sees you and hesitates for a minute.
He then goes to the person standing beside you and asks for directions to a hotel. You wonder why he walked past you and turn to see the other person he is asking help. 

Note: Click on the slide to view a photo.
Say: Now, this is the person he went to seek help.
¬†
Ask: Why do you think the foreigner did not approach you for help? 
¬†
Possible Answers:
The other person looked decent and wise.
I was dressed inappropriately to travel in a bus.
I was also looking lost
¬†
Say: Yes! Many of you got it right. That person is dressed in simple yet clean clothes. His attention to dressing enhanced his appearance and gave him self-confidence. As a result, he has a matured look that would make anyone think he is a reliable person. Therefore, the man sought his help rather than yours.

Looks Matter A Lot!

When you look decent at work

People will prefer to talk to you.
You will look professional and reliable.

When you look indecent at work

People will ignore you and talk to your colleague.
You will feel let down.

People judge us based on our looks. Our looks send the first signal about our potential.

Be aware of personal grooming standards and importance of hygiene.

Follow standards of personal grooming.

Win over the guests

Gain more confidence from superiors

üìù Notes:
When you become a Front office associate, you will be interacting with the guests all the time. You will definitely feel let down if a guest requests your supervisor to send another person when you are doing their check-in. You can avoid such disappointments at work by dressing up to look professional and reliable. 
¬†
Say: To achieve this, you should follow the standards set for personal grooming for front office staff. For example, if the hotel you work for wants you to wear neat and clean uniform, you have to. When you present yourself as per the grooming standards, it will encourage guests to interact with you without hesitation. This will give you a chance to win over your guests. When guests have a good opinion about you, your superiors will gain more confidence in you. Therefore, you need to be aware of the grooming standards and the importance of hygiene. Then you need to apply them at work.

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Begin the slide with a question. 
Ask the girls to answer to the question and keep up this discussion for about 3 minutes. 
Then, proceed to Say.
¬†
Ask: Look at these four earrings. Which of these will you wear for work? 
¬†
Note: Encourage the girls to choose an earring and give a reason for choosing it. 
Say: Good choice. I would say the second and third earrings are more appropriate for the job. 
¬†
The jewellery you wear at work should be simple and not obviously visible to the guests. It should give you a professional look. You cannot wear inappropriate or indecent jewellery to the hotel. For example, you should wear only post-style earrings, which are usually called as studs. You cannot wear danglers, as they would not suit your uniform dress. 
¬†
You can wear a ring only on one finger. Sometimes, wedding rings come as a set and they are considered as one ring. If you want to wear a necklace, have it under the garment so that it is not visible to others. 
¬†
Your hands will be in constant touch with plates, glassware and cutlery. Therefore, you need to take special care of them. Keep your fingernails trimmed and clean. The nail shape and length should be short. You can apply nail polish in a neutral colour that goes well with the uniform colour. However, the colour should not be chipped on any day. You should also not have designs on the nails. You could wear a simple wristwatch if you want. 
¬†
You know front office is not a desk-job. You will need to walk around all day. You should wear simple and low-heel shoes or pumps so that you do not strain your legs due to excessive walking. 
¬†
Your hotel will give you the uniform to wear on the job. You should keep the uniform clean and neat. In case your uniform is torn, you should ensure that it is properly hemmed. 
¬†
These are some of the common grooming standards for front office female staff. You will get a comprehensive list of standards from the hotel you will work.

Getting Noticed - Women

Face

Wear minimum makeup. 
Choose natural colours and light shades in cosmetics.
Do not pierce your eyebrows or shape them in fancy designs.
Choose a glass frame and lens design that go well with the shape of your face.
Maintain a consistent colour for your hair.

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Conduct fun discussions in between the teaching session so that all girls/women participate actively.
This row covers the first objective ‚Äì Adhere to the grooming standards for front office staff.
 
Ask: When you see an individual, what is the first thing that you notice? 
¬†
Possible Answers:
Hair
Face
Dress
¬†
Note: Click once to view the contents on the slide.
Say: Well, all of these could be correct. I think when you see a person the first thing that registers in your mind is his or her face. That brings us to a more important aspect of grooming for women ‚Äì the makeup. Isn‚Äôt makeup a very important activity for women? 
¬†
Note: Expect giggles and funny responses from the learners. 
Say: You can wear minimum makeup so that you enhance the natural features of the face and also look like a true professional. You should not apply gaudy makeup. The colour of the lipstick should be natural. You can use eye shadow provided it is in light shade. 
¬†
The front office standards for face recommend that you should not pierce your eyebrows or shape them in fancy designs. A common accessory for the face would be the eyeglasses. If you need to wear eyeglass under medical prescription, you should get prior permission from the management. You must make sure that the glass frame and the lens design go well with your face shape and uniform. When you are not using the glasses, you should not hang them from your pocket or in a band around your neck.
¬†
Another important part of your face that is instantly visible to the guests is your hair. How many of you here wear wigs?  
¬†
Note: Expect giggles and funny responses from the learners. 
Say: None? That‚Äôs good. Because if you wear wigs or hair pieces while working, make sure they are similar to natural hair. You cannot have black hair on one day and wear a blonde wig the next day.

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Conduct fun discussions in between the teaching so that all boys/men participate actively.
This row covers the first objective ‚Äì Adhere to the grooming standards for front office staff.
¬†
Say: We will now learn the grooming standards for men. 
Click to highlight the picture of the man.
¬†
Ask: How many men here love to experiment with different cool haircuts and styles? 
¬†
Note: Encourage men to raise their hands and explain the hair styles they like the most.
¬†
Say: Well, you have to stop loving trendy and cool hairstyles. You cannot have them when you are a Front office associate. You should trim your hair neatly such that the front of your hair does not touch your eyebrows and the back does not touch the collar of the shirt. Your hair should never be unkempt or ruffled. You should comb or brush your hair neatly and regularly. The hair on the crown, that is, the sides of the head should not be lengthy and hide your ear. It should not extend below the mid of your ear. There should be an even width of strip on each side of your head. The tip of this hair should be horizontally straight.
¬†
If you are using a hair colour, make sure it is natural in colour. Like I said before, you should not come with black hair on one day and burgundy on the next. Your guests will be baffled! Maintain a consistent hairstyle. Do not shave your hair or colour it to depict your favourite sports team or movie star. That does not look professional. I am sure none of you here needs a hair wig. However, even if you do, pick a wig that is close to your natural hair colour. Personally, I would say going bald as a man is cooler than to wear wigs. What is your opinion on that? 
¬†
Note: Though this is not directly relevant to the session, this question is to break the monotonous teaching of the standards. It also helps the learners to develop an opinion about hairstyles.
¬†
Say: That was an interesting point from each of you. I am sure you will have better opinions about hairstyles once you step into the industry.
¬†
The next important set of standards is for the face. You can wear a beard if your religion insists, however, crop it closely or tie it neatly as per the religious norms. If you wear eyeglasses under medical prescription, you should get prior permission from the management. You must make sure that the glass frame and the lens design go well with your face shape and uniform. When you are not using the glasses, you should not hang them from your pocket or in a band around your neck. 
¬†
The standards for jewellery are minimal for men due to obvious reasons. You can wear a ring only on one finger. Sometimes, wedding rings come as a set and they are considered as one ring. If you want to wear a chain, have it under the garment so that it is not visible to others. 
¬†
Your hands should be clean as you will be responsible for cleaning the hotel offices and areas. You should wash them regularly. Trim the nails and keep them clean. Particularly, there should be no nicotine stains or other marks on your hands. 
And the last grooming standard for men relates to the shoes.
¬†
Ask: How many of you wear shoes regularly? 
¬†
Note: This will be a general discussion for about 3 minutes. There are no right or wrong responses. 
Say: Well, you have to be prepared to wear shoes every day to work. Mostly, the hotels you work for will give the shoes to maintain uniformity among all employees. You have to wear the shoes all the time on duty. Polish the shoes every day and tie the lace properly.

Attributes and Personal Traits of Front office associate

HOS_S07

üìù Notes:
Trainer‚Äôs Instruction:
Give one line description for each personal trait from experience.

Say:
Along with proper grooming another important aspect is personal traits. It reflects on our personality.
Front office associate should have a pleasant personality and should be approachable.
Physical fitness is imperative as FOA are always on the go. They are expected to reach and handle a crisis situation in split of a second.
Personal hygiene we have discussed in detail before. A smelly and untidy looking FOA is only an unwelcoming being in the lobby.
FOA have to be very observant. They should have eye for detail. For example can anyone tell me, approximately how many shops are there in a radius of 100 mtrs of our institute? Elicit answers and applaud when answered correctly.
Calm demeanor is explained by remaining calm and composed in a pressure full situation.
FOA should always be courteous, both verbally and in actions.
FOA are expected be on time always. Reporting late implies lack of interest in the job.
Sharp memory proves to be a boon for a FOA. You will be expected to remember names of all the guest whom you meet even once in the hotel.
Integrity and loyalty towards the organization signifies on the success of both the employee and the organisation. Breach of any rules or regulations can be reprimanded with disciplinary action.

Punctuality: Punctuality reflects the interest of the staff towards work. If staff does not report on time on regular basis, it shows lack of interest

Honesty: It is very important as it reflects the character of a person. The staff may be tempted to eat guests‚Äô food or steal things from the rooms or tell lies but it is important to remain honest in face of such temptations.
¬†
Loyalty: The staff should be loyal to the organisation in which they are working. You should not talk bad about your organization or colleagues.

Good Conduct: The conduct of the staff is very important specially in front of guests. Rude behaviour and arguing will damage the organisation‚Äôs reputation. Rules and regulations must be followed and organisation must be given due respect.

üìù Notes:
Say:
Similar to the trains, hotel industry provides food and lodging to people travelling destinations away from home. There are various stages of interface between a guest and a hotel ‚Äì pre arrival, arrival, stay and departure.
Pre Arrival  consists of Researching the hotels and Making reservation.
Arrival stage consists of Actually arriving at the hotel and Checking in after registration.
Stay includes Using the guest room and amenities.
Departure happens once the guest pays the final settlement and checks out.
All guests go through the same procedure as they proceed from pre arrival stage to the departure stage. The various activities carried in between are called the guest cycle.
In todays session we will focus primarily on Pre arrival ‚Äì Making a reservation.

üìù Notes:
Say:
The first interaction between a guest and a hotel is when the guest enquires about room availability and makes a room booking or reservation.
Now reservation is a very important part of the guest‚Äôs experience as it gives an assurance to the guest that the desired room will be available for the guest on the required dates and ensures a comfortable stay at the hotel.
The interaction between a guest and a hotel happens before the guest arrives at the hotel. This is called the Pre-arrival stage of the guest cycle. We will learn in detail about each and every stage of the guest cycle in sessions to come. Today we will focus on Hotel reservations.

Reservation can be defined as ‚Äò a contract between a particular guest and the hotel for the purpose of blocking a particular type of guest room like -  single, double, suits etc. for a definite period of time, i.e number of days of stay.
When a guest makes an advance reservation at a hotel, it is expected that the hotel will honor its commitment by providing the specified type of room when the guest arrives. For this purpose, all hotel accept advance bookings of their rooms to achieve high occupancy and to maximize their revenue.

Reservation requests can come by various ways. 
Can anyone guess what are the ways with which you or guest may approach any hotel for reserving a room.
Elicit answers from the learners.

The reservation process can be carried out in two ways ‚Äì Verbal or Written.
We will understand these methods in detail.

[[OCR Image Text: ... ANO
ACTION‚Äô]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
Before we begin this part of the session, let us perform an activity with the knowledge we already have.
I need one volunteer who will act as a reservation associate. I will act as a businessman ‚Äì Mr. Sharma who wants to book a room in your hotel.
Do not worry, we need not to be perfect. Let us see how this telephone conversation goes.

Proceed to trainer‚Äôs instruction.
Trainer‚Äôs instruction ‚Äì 
Select one learner to perform the role play of the reservation associate.
Announce  the situation that needs to be enacted ‚Äì 
A business man Mr. Sharma is visiting Delhi for the first time. He wants to stay in your hotel and needs a single room for 3 nights ‚Äì 14th May 2018 to 16th May 2018. He calls the hotel and the reservation associate( learner) answers the call through EPABX.

The role of Mr. Sharma has to be done by the trainer. 
Engage in conversation for about 10 minutes.
At this point the learner would not know what all details need to be asked. The trainer has to prompt to generate questions and answers.
Give pointers to the learner mentioning the details fictionally, as follows :
Full name
Number of guests
Date of arrival, date of departure
Reason to visit the hotel and the city
Address for communication
Type of room
Room rate and Tax component = Full amount to be settled
Mode of payment
Closing of the conversation by confirming the reservation.

Appreciate the learners and transit to the next slide for verbal reservation explanation.

üìù Notes:
Say:
That was an interesting role play. 
In this situation the reservation enquiry came through telephone. It can also come in person. If you are a guest you can always go yourself to make a reservation or send a colleague, friend, relative to book a room on your behalf if in case you are not available to do so.
The advantage of verbal reservation is it is fast, convenient and generates immediate response. You can clear any doubt and get the complete information through verbal reservation. 
But the important thing is to get a printed acknowledgement or a receipt of the advance payment of the room reservation as a permanent record for further use.

We will now see the written mode of reservation.

üìù Notes:
(Do not click in the beginning of the slide)
Say:
When a reservation reaches the hotel in writing, the mode is classified as a written mode of reservation.
Can you guess any such examples of written mode of reservation enquiries?
Generate response from the learners. Elicit answers and engage in discussion for 5 minutes.

Say:
The different written modes include ‚Äì (Click)
Letter ‚Äì This mode was commonly used by tour and travel operators and confirmed correspondence was sent by the hotel. Though this method is now out of trends because of internet and email.
Fax -  Are also called facsimile transmission. Hotel receive the Xerox copies of reservation request through fax machines along with the credit card authorization (front and back of the card) from the guest, to guarantee reservation. The hotel sends the confirmation letter through fax to the guest.
Email ‚Äì The guest sends the reservation request to the hotel‚Äôs email address, to which the hotel will process the request and send it back to the guest.
Travel Websites ‚Äì Examples of travel websites are yatra.com, makemytrip.com etc. They have a link with the hotels in which the guest can make a booking directly on the website and make a payment for guaranteed reservation. Immediately an invoice confirming the same is generated on the guests screen. 

The advantage of written reservation is that they are clear, unambiguous and provide a written record for the hotel and the guest.
The only disadvantage is that it takes time to reach the hotel if incase it is a letter, which is not a very preferred way in the modern times. The other part is it is largely dependent on the technology and internet.

Tentative

Confirmed

Waitlisted

Guaranteed Reservation

Non Guaranteed Reservation

üìù Notes:
(Do not click at the beginning of the slide)
Ask:
Before we begin this section, can anyone guess what can be the types of reservation? You may think on the lines of railways, like waiting list.
Generate response from the learners. Engage in discussion.

Say:
Again, you all are absolutely correct. Like the railways, hotels also has various types of reservation. 
Hotel accepts reservations for their rooms and suites only after checking various factors such as :
Sales Forecast ‚Äì shows if the period is busy or relatively not so busy. For example near to Ganesh Chaturthi in Mumbai , almost all the hotels would be booked for the festival. So, it will be classified as a busy period.
Room Rates ‚Äì If there was a discount involved or not.
Profile of the guest ‚Äì Blacklisted or otherwise. VIP guest etc.

(Click) The reservation made by a guest could be tentative, confirmed or waitlisted.
Once a reservation request is processed by the hotel, the hotel will guarantee or non-guarantee the reservation.

Types of Reservation, continued

¬© Tata Community Initiatives Trust , all rights reserved.

üìù Notes:
Say:
Tentative reservation ‚Äì 
It is a reservation that a prospective guest makes on a tentative basis for particular stay dates. The hotel holds the room for that guest till a cut off date, by which the guest should confirm the reservation. If the guest confirms the request, the hotel confirms the reservation and the rooms. If the guest fails to confirm, the tentative reservation gets cancelled and records are updated accordingly.

Waitlisted reservation ‚Äì 
A reservation is waitlisted when the requested category of room is not available for the requested dates. The hotel does not guarantee a room for a waitlisted category. If there is a cancellation or no show of any other booking of the same room type, then the waitlisted reservation may get confirmed.

Confirmed reservation ‚Äì 
Once the guest confirms the reservation request, the hotel blocks a room for a specified stay dates and sends a written confirmation of the same to the guest, containing all the details of the guest, and payment details. It also has a section of special requests such as ‚Äì airport assistance, wheel chair, baby sitter, non smoking room etc. A confirmed reservation can be of two types.
Guaranteed reservation 
Non guaranteed reservation

Guaranteed and Non Guaranteed

¬© Tata Community Initiatives Trust , all rights reserved.

üìù Notes:
Say:
A guaranteed reservation is a confirmation that the hotel will hold the reserved room for the guest and not release it to any other guest even if the guest doesn‚Äôt arrive on time. This requires the guest to make an advance payment as per the hotel‚Äôs policy.
It can be obtained through ‚Äì 
Pre payment ‚Äì It protects the hotel from any loss of revenue if in case of last moment cancellation or a no show. It can be done by cash, credit card or by demand drafts or nowadays NEFT online transfers.
Contractual agreement ‚Äì According to contractual agreement the hotel confirms the reservation for the individual or a person referred by the corporates or company or a travel agent on a guaranteed basis and the company or the travel agent agrees to pay for the reservation, even if it is a no show or cancellation. Hotels guarantee these reservations on the basis of a letter from the company called, a bill to company or BTC letter, acknowledging the guest as its employee or client and agreeing to pay their bills as per the contract.

A non guaranteed reservation is a situation where the guest confirms their reservation but does not guarantee it with an advance payment. In this case, the hotel agrees to hold the room for the guest till the cancellation hour, unless  the guest informs the hotel about their late arrival. The cancellation hour is a time fixed by the hotel after which a non-guaranteed reservation stands cancelled, and the hotel releases the room to any other requirement. This guest is classified as a ‚ÄòNo show‚Äù.

Sources of Reservation

¬© Tata Community Initiatives Trust , all rights reserved.

üìù Notes:
Say:
A hotel receives reservation requests from different sources ‚Äì like direct guests, central reservation system or global distribution system, travel agencies, companies etc.
Let us try to understand each of these sources briefly.
CRS or central reservation system ‚Äì This system enables guest to make reservation in any of the hotel of any particular chain, at any destination in one single call. For example, an American couple is travelling for 8 nights, say from 10th -18th November on the Golden triangle ‚Äì Delhi ‚Äì Agra ‚Äì Jaipur and return to Delhi.
So will the couple individually call the hotels in Delhi, then Agra and the Jaipur to check for reservation?
Elicit response from the learners.

I am sure it will take a lot of time if the guest has to call up all the three hotels separately for room availability and reservation request. With the help of CRS, it is done in one single call. This guest would have to call any ONE hotel and all the reservation in the other hotels would be gradually done by the system. The CRS helps the guest get the information and room availability status for all group hotels and to plan their itinerary in one email or phone call.

Intersell Agencies ‚Äì It is an agency that deals with many products such as hotels, flights, car rentals, travel arrangement, tour operators etc. For example Expedia, makemytrip, Travelguru etc.

Global Distribution System or GDS ‚Äì It is a worldwide computerized reservation network. Some examples are Amadeus IT, Galileo CRS, Sabre(Semi Automated business research environment), Worldspan etc. This network is usually used by travel agents to use number of products like airline, hotels, car rentals etc, across counties and continents.

Agencies ‚Äì Travel agencies like Thomas cook book or plan entire tour and travels for the guest which includes airport transfers, flight tickets, hotel reservation, local sightseeing, guided tour etc.

Corporates and Government sector ‚Äì Companies, government bodies and NGOS, WHO, Embassies, consulates etc. usually have a contracted agreement on rates for rooms if and when required.

Hotel websites ‚Äì This website contains link for reservation request. The guest can directly access the reservation guide and book for the desired dates of stay. An advance payment is asked by the website at the end to assure a guaranteed reservation.

[[OCR Image Text: | AMADEUS]]

üìù Notes:
Ask:
We have seen that nowadays the reservation system is largely dependent upon the technology and internet. But let me ask you all a question here. Imagine a small family run hotel in a serene hills of Manali. The hotel has only 10 rooms, gives services for lodging and dining. Do you think they would have the facility of high technology for adapting a reservation system?
Discuss for about 15 minutes. Discuss on the lines of Manali being a hill station there might not be a good source of telecom provider itself. Then prompt responses of the learners towards manual system of reservation. Proceed to say.

Say:
Depending upon the needs of the hotel, and the volume of the business, a hotel may adopt either a manual system or an automatic system of reservation.

Manual System of reservation :
The reservations are maintained manually and is a very old school process.  It is further classified into 
Diary system of reservation
Whitney system of reservation

These two systems formed the basis of current automatic systems of reservation. Though these are mostly obsolete but it is important to learn about them briefly.

Whitney System of Reservation

Whitney Rack for the year 2018 ‚Äì 
150 rooms in a hotel

üìù Notes:
Say:
This system of room reservation, developed by the American Whitney Duplicating Check Company, is suitable for small and medium properties ‚Äì with upto 150 rooms. It is based on the use of slips called Whitney slips or Shannon slips which can be held over metallic racks called Whitney Racks.

The racks are vertically mounted on walls. It requires a total of 43 racks.
31 racks are for each day in the current month, arranged as per the date of the month.
11 racks are for the next eleven months of the year.
1 rack is for the next year.

As soon as a reservation request is received, it is processed, Whitney slips are made in duplicate. The slips are then placed in the Whitney rack.

Automatic Systems of Reservation

¬© Tata Community Initiatives Trust , all rights reserved.

These are computerized system of reservation systems that are used to store and retrieve room status information and conduct transactions. 
The information stored in manual system and automatic system are the same.

üìù Notes:
Say:
These are computerised system of reservation systems that are used to store and retrieve room status information and conduct transactions. The information stored in manual system and automatic system are the same. However, the processing of reservation request does not require manual study of registers, diaries and charts. The availability of rooms can be checked by the associate by a single click  on a computer.  If a room is available the system automatically blocks a room as per the request  for the required duration of time and removes it from available inventory of rooms. 
As we have seen the examples before CRS, GDS, Websites are all examples of Automatic system of reservation.

SOP ‚Äì Standard operating procedure

¬© Tata Community Initiatives Trust , all rights reserved.

üìù Notes:
Say:
So can we define how the reservation is made in not more than 3 steps?
Can anyone give me the steps and I shall write on the whiteboard here.
Elicit response from the learners. Write the responses on white board. Then proceed to say.

Say:
Every hotel has its own SOP or Standard operating procedure to handle a reservation request. But it is the same principle followed all over the world.
STEPS
Receive the reservation enquiry ‚Äì It has to be very fast. When an enquiry reach the hotel through any source, only a few question should be asked to make the process fast. Such as ‚Äì date and time of arrival/ departure, Number and type of rooms, Number of guests. Any other details like name and contact address can be taken after checking the room availability.
Determine the room availability ‚Äì By using the Standard operating procedure.
Process the request ‚Äì Accept or deny the reservation request -  Here is the step that is the conclusion of a reservation enquiry. The manner in which the reservation associate interacts with the guest, goes a long way in determining the guest‚Äôs impression of the hotel. At this stage all the other details of the guests are gathered, such as name, address, company, reason for visiting etc.

What happens next?

¬© Tata Community Initiatives Trust , all rights reserved.

üìù Notes:
Say:
Once the availability of room is confirmed, the hotel blocks a room for the guests and sends a confirmation letter to the guest. The reservation transaction is allotted a number, known as a confirmation number, mentioned in the confirmation letter. 

The reservation department may choose to turn down the request in the following cases:
The hotel is fully booked.
The type of room is not available.
The guest is blacklisted.

When denying a specific request, the associate should always be polite, apologize and be helpful.  An alternative suggestion of a room or a hotel may be presented after consulting the supervisor/ manager on shift.

Registration process

üìù Notes:
Say:
Registration is the first step of check-in activity of any guest.
The process begins when the guest arrives at the reception/front desk and terminates when the guest signs all the documents.

In simpler words it is an legal agreement between the hotel and the guest. The hotel will provide the safe and secure lodging, boarding facility in exchange of revenue from the guest for the services received.
It can be broadly divided into a Four Step process.
Collection
Product Matching
Revenue Management
Rooms Management

Warm welcome - Greeting

üìù Notes:
Say:
Similarly the spirit of Indian hospitality should reflect in each one of us when we meet  and welcome a guest for the first time. 

Just imagine, you are a guest in a hotel and you have entered the lobby, but no one has approached you.
How do you feel? How would you feel about the hotel and its staff!
Encourage learners to give some answers.

Horrible, isn‚Äôt it? And you may never like to come again, right?
That is why greeting and making the guest comfortable is very important. We have said earlier ‚Äì first impression is the last impression. At the first moment, you have the only opportunity to create the complete image of the hotel. For the guest you are the entire company or organization
You only have one chance to make a positive impression, so get it right! 
It‚Äôs like going to meet someone for the first time wearing a dirty, torn up shirt and bad breath, chances are, you might not get to meet them again!!
Same goes for our hotels. If we make an amazing first impression, they‚Äôre sure to come back! Our satisfied guests will often overlook small issues, if we know how to properly¬†welcome them.

Make the guest comfortable ‚Äì offer more
than expected!

Arrival team -
Includes doormen, concierge and bell desk, butlers and receptionists.

It‚Äôs the personal touches that boost customer loyalty

‚ÄòAsking mindset.‚Äô

[[OCR Image Text: WOW,]]

üìù Notes:
Say: 
Our guests can get a warm, welcoming feeling from something as simple as a smile from the doorman, it starts at that!
People quickly notice when you are not giving them your full attention. It‚Äôs about greeting them by name, adapting to their mood and really taking an interest.

Offering little more than what is expected is an excellent habit. Think of the last time you paid someone for a service. Did you get  more than you expected? Think of a time when you visit a movie and got a small tub of popcorn free? Will you not feel great because you got more than your money‚Äôs worth? 
Similarly, if the guest is staying for a special occasion, leave a small gift, such as chocolates, a fruit bowl with a handwritten welcome card from the hotel manager. (As per the company‚Äôs policy).

Once in the room, staff should show the guest where the main amenities are. They should also give their name so the guest can contact them if they need anything. They should then wish the guest a pleasant stay using their name.

Sure, as hospitality professionals, we want our guests to be happy. But many times we don‚Äôt fully understand how to actually make that happen. You need to be in the ‚Äòasking mindset.‚Äô

Ask questions & be¬†empathetic¬†‚Äì¬†Learning more about your guests will definitely make an impression on them. Asking questions shows you care, but it also helps you anticipate their needs.
¬†What brings you to the area?
¬†How was your trip in?
¬†Have you stayed with us before?
¬†Where are you from?
¬†I understand traveling through a packed airport can be challenging‚Ä¶

Add a word of caution after the questions. You shouldn't become too intimidating while asking questions and no personal questions.

Activity 3, Intimidating welcome - video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IndJir1FI0

üìù Notes:
Say:
‚ÄòLove actually‚Äô is a very famous Hollywood movie. In a scene there is Rowan Atkinson, who usually plays Mr. Beans. Atkinson is acting for the role of a jewelry sales person. 
Play the movie on youtube.

After the video, say:
A customer comes to him, selects a necklace. But Atkinson takes so much time in delivery the necklace that ultimately customer refuses to buy the necklace anymore. 
We should be always be able to judge the customer's willingness to answer questions. He may be too tired after the journey. In this video the gift wrapping took so much time, in our lives registration should also happen quickly but correct.

Eye contact

üìù Notes:
Say:
Eye contact is a non verbal body language. 
Eye contact provides social information to the person you are listening to and talking to. Too much eye contact and you could be seen as aggressive, too little eye contact and you can be seen as having no interest in the person speaking. 
Eye contact¬†produces feelings of caring, trustworthiness and likability.

Grooming Standards

üìù Notes:
Say: 
We have discussed at length on importance of grooming standards.

To revise the grooming standards always remember:
Be sure you are well groomed always.
Check your appearance frequently, and correct it if need be.
Do not smoke/eat in clear view of the guest.
Keep the work space tidy.
Carry yourself with pride.
And remember to always smile.

Possible Answers:
There could be more people from one family who wish to stay together.
Guests may have different budget.

Say: 
You are right! Earlier many hotels used to have standard rooms with more or less the same facilities. Now, however, the trend is changing. Hotels now offer guests various options ranging from the standard rooms to those that have upgraded amenities and facilities.

Do you think look of the room plays a role in making a guest room saleable?

HOS_S05

Can you think of some expectations of the guests when they stay in a hotel room?

üìù Notes:
Say: 
We will begin the session with a small discussion on hotel rooms or guestrooms, as they are normally referred to. Guest rooms are one of the primary sources of income for every hotel. The guest rooms are known to contribute more than 50% of the total sales. In the pictures on the screen, you see two different kind of rooms. 
¬†
Ask:
Can you think of some expectations of the guests when they stay in hotel room?
¬†
Possible Answers:
Relaxation
Pleasure
Convenience
Necessity
¬†
Say:
Thank you for the answers. Yes, guests have different requirements when they stay in hotel rooms. Guests stay in hotel rooms when they want to relax, stay in a safe place in a new city, or live in a place that is close to their business needs. Hotels offer different types of rooms to cater to the varying needs of guests. For example, look at the rooms on the slide. Both rooms shown on the slide look well-furnished, spacious, and with a window that opens to the city. Although both rooms seem different in appearance, someone who wants a room with two beds would opt for the first room and someone who wants a room with a double bed would opt for the second room.  
¬†
Note: Click once to view the contents on the slide.
¬†
Ask: Do you think the look of the room plays a role in making a guest room saleable?
¬†
Possible Answers:
Yes, how a room is presented to a guest has a deep impact on whether the guest will opt for the room
No, the reputation of the hotel and the pricing of the room is more important
¬†
Say: That‚Äôs right! How you present a room to a guest will have an impact on whether the guest will opt for the room. The housekeeping team is responsible for cleanliness in all areas in the hotel. When the rooms are clean and in order, guests will feel comfortable and will be willing to stay. Other than the cleanliness, the housekeeping department also maintains the overall appeal of the guest room by decorating it appropriately. For example, the housekeeping department may also arrange for fresh flowers for room decoration, if the guests so desire. They also offer to launder guest clothes, manage the look of the floors, and carry the luggage to the room to provide complete comfortable stay for the guests. Some of the other housekeeping activities include gardening, laundry, floor management, and bellhops. Hence housekeeping and front office team have to be closely coordinated for an efficient guest experience.

Debrief: 
Instructions:
Conclude the section by debriefing the participants.
Ask the question and take responses from the participants. 
¬†
Ask:
Do you think that every hotel has more than one type of room to offer?
¬†
Possible Answers:
Yes, all hotels have a variety of rooms to offer. 
No, options for guest rooms are available depending on the type of hotel.
¬†
Say:
Yes! Mostly.  Many hotels offer more than one type of rooms. The choice of rooms always rests with the guest. However, the hotel receptionist or front office staff usually suggests an ideal room to the guests based on their requirement.
¬†
Transition: I am sure you now have a basic idea about the types of guest rooms. Lets see some of the guest room to understand more.

üìù Notes:

Reservation in hotel industry is defined as ‚Äúblocking a particular type of room ‚Äì single, double, twin etc. for a definite duration of time for a particular guest.

Hotel accepts reservation for their rooms only after checking the availability, sales forecast, room rates, profile of the guest and their importance to the hotel. Depending on which a reservation enquiry can be tentative, confirmed ‚Äì guaranteed and non guaranteed or waitlisted. But never denied.

Possible answers
Phone
Personally
I don‚Äôt know

Say:
You all are absolutely correct! 
There are several ways to enquire about room reservations by the guest.
Click to reveal the slide.

Read from the slide.

Usually the guest who approaches a hotel in person has a chance of not getting a confirmed reservation. These guests are called ‚ÄúWalk-in‚Äù guest. The guest who communicate in advance to the hotel via written modes have a bigger chance of getting a confirmed reservation. 

An important point to note over here is the communication process when receiving an enquiry over telephone. It is called phonetics. Lets see what that means.

üìù Notes:
Say:
Some letters sound alike when spoken over a telephone line. In these cases the message has to be very clear to avoid any problem later. In case you are not sure of the spelling of the guest names as per the guests pronunciation you can always reconfirm the spelling phonetically.
For example:
One lady calls you on a front desk to make a reservation in the name of Mrs. Suzanne. You may think it is spelt as ‚ÄòSusan‚Äô. In this case verify the name with the guest phonetically.
Say ‚Äú May I spell your name please S for Sierra, U for uniform, S for Sierra‚Äù‚Ä¶ then the guest would immediately correct you and say.. ‚ÄùNo no it is Z for zoo.‚Äù
Then you continue spelling the name as Z for Zulu, A for Alpha, N for November, N for November and E for echo.
This process eliminates the need for any further clarification and avoids confusion at the time of registration.

Who is a Walk in Guest?

Handling a Walk in Guest

üìù Notes:
Say:
A guest who arrives at a hotel without a reservation is called as 'Walk in'.
Imagine a tired guest who must have travelled a very long distance, changing multiple flights, then¬†‚Äôwalk(s)-in‚Äô to ¬†the hotels and find that the hotel is fully occupied.
In general, hotels have no obligations to accommodate guests who arrive ¬†without reservation when no rooms are available for the night.

Ask:
What will you do if such a situation happens with you? Will you turn away the guest?
Choose 3 learners and encourage them to answer. Keep the discussion for about 5 minutes.

Say:
In hospitality industry, no is not answer. Guest is equivalent to god. SO we can not turn away a guest.
When the hotel cannot accommodate a walk-in guest, the front office agent can make the situation a little easy for the guest by:
Suggesting and providing directions to alternative hotels nearby.
Call other similar hotels and help the guest to make reservation.
If there seems to be no alternative to turning away the guest, A MANAGER not a front desk agent, should explain the matter in a private office.
Registering one guest in view of another who cannot be accommodated¬†can be extremely awkward and embarrassing.

When the reservation is created for walk-in guest the source segment of the reservation should be tagged as 'Walk-In'.
It is important to note - It is also a good practice to collect a advance deposit for the complete room rental and approximate incidental charges from a Walk-in guest. However, this has to be done as per the hotel policy.

Reserved Guest

üìù Notes:
Say:
Now let us see how the procedure is followed if in case the guest comes with confirmed reservation.
When a guest arrives at the hotel, he must be first welcomed. After that if the guest says that he holds a confirmed reservation, it means he is already preregistered. Pre registration are the activities carried out by the front desk agents before the arrival of the guest, which helps accelerate the process of guest registration.
Check the day‚Äôs arrival list and verify the guests reservation status ‚Äì if it is confirmed or denied.
Ask the guest to verify their details in pre filled Guest registration card. It will have details like date of arrival, departure, name, company, passport details, purpose of visit etc.
Depending on the availability of the rooms, allot the room as per the guest‚Äôs preference.
Establish the mode of settlement of bills ‚Äì cash, cheques, bill to company, travellers cheque etc. Assign the room key.
Call the bell boy for luggage assistance. Wish the guest a happy stay and update the records.

How will you address a married lady?
How  will you address a lady whose marital status is not known?
How will you address a doctor, army personnel, or any other service professional?

Say:
It is very important to address the guest appropriately and mention the same way in the guest paperwork.
Married lady are to be address as ‚Äòmrs‚Äô or pronounced as missus. Unmarried ladies are address as Ms. But usually this a very sensitive matter. So when in doubt we use M/s. 
For professionals or servicemen it is important to address them with their proper rank or designation. Like chief, general, doctor.
For children we use both Master and miss.

Because you were asking your friends you could speak in a candid manner. When working in hotels, you will have to use the correct phraseology.  Phraseology is nothing but choice of words. Like ‚Äì
Allow me to fill in the details for you. (Offer to fill in the details for the guest. If possible get the details from the guest‚Äôs reservation sheet.)
Please sign here.
May I please ask for your passport?
May I please ask you to verify the details.
Kindly check the details and other information before signing the card. (This step is done when you have filled in the details for the guest, but want him to check the information like spellings, contact number etc.)
If you please let me know your purpose of visit____.
After staying with us, where is it likely that you would be proceeding?
Your expected date of departure would be‚Ä¶?
Could you please___?

We will learn more about the common phrases that should be used in the hotel industry in modules to come. But till then remember to smile and be polite, all the time.

Room status terminology

HOTEL ROOM TERMINOLOGY

Distribute handout

üìù Notes:
Say: 
During the guest‚Äôs stay, the Front office/housekeeping status of the guestroom changes several times. The various terms defined are typical of the room status terminology of the lodging industry. This is important to understand the room inventory available for each day.
I will distribute a handout for your ready reference. Time and again we will be using these terminologies. In coming sessions we will be learning about these in detail.

Occupied(O OR OCC): A guest is currently registered to the room.
Complimentary(COMP): The room is occupied, but the guest is assessed no charge for its use
Stay Over: The guest is not expected to check out today and will remain at least one more night
On-change(O/C) : The guest has departed, but the room has not yet been cleaned and readied for re-sale
Do Not Disturb(DND): The guest has requested not to be disturbed
Sleep-out: A guest is registered to the room, but the bed has not been used.
Skipper: The guest has left the hotel without making arrangements to settle his or her account
Sleeper(NC) : The guest has settled his or her account and left the hotel, but the front office staff has failed to properly update the room‚Äôs status
Vacant and ready or Checked and Ready (V/C OR CR): The room has been cleaned and inspected and is ready for an arriving guest
Out-of-order(OOO) : The room cannot be assigned to a guest. A room may be out-of-order for a variety of reasons including the need for maintenance, refurbishing, and extensive cleaning.
Out of Service (OOS ):¬†Rooms kept under out of service are not deducted from the hotel inventory. This is a temporary blocking and reasons may be bulb fuse, T V remote not working, Kettle not working etc. These rooms are not assigned to the guest once these small maintenance issues are fixed.
Double Lock(DL) : The guest room door is locked from inside and outside two times so that no one can enter.
Lockout: The room has been locked so that the guest cannot re-enter until a hotel official clears him or her
DNCO(Did Not check out) : The guest made arrangements to settle his or her account (and thus is not a skipper), but has left without informing the front office.
Due out: The room is expected to become vacant after the following day‚Äôs checkout time
Checkout: The guest has settled his or her account, returned the room keys, and left the hotel
Late Check-out: The guest has requested and is being allowed to check out later than the hotel‚Äôs standard check-out time.
Back to back : a full house situation where there are equal no. of arrivals and departures

How to WOW a guest?

[[OCR Image Text: Alorwsor]]

üìù Notes:
It can be done by two ways ‚Äì Through conversation with the guest. Second by the eye of observation. Example when you notice that the guest is from Tamil nadu and you provide local Tamil newspaper in their room. Will it not create a WOW!

Some more examples are:
Guest is left handed. So offer a pen to sign likewise.
Guest is allergic to nuts.
Preference of diet coke as welcome drink.
Guest prefers room temperature of 26C.
Preferred pillow type.
Preferred time of turndown services.
Pool side room.
Guest is a frequent traveller and likes the room to be serviced by one particular houseman only.

You should all have a keen observation power to execute the guest preferences when you working the hotel and create a WOW for the guest.

üìù Notes:
Say:
Now that we have learnt how to handle a walk-in and reserved guest registration, lets see what all documents ¬†and other information are required for completing a registration process. Verification and re-verification is very important at this stage for the safety and security of the hotels, employees and all the other guests.

Revenue management means how and when the revenue for the room will be received from the guest. i.e. to say the details of the billing instructions ‚Äì cash, travellers cheque, bill to company, credit cards etc.

The mode of payment refers to the various methods of payment by which the guest can pay his/her bills in the hotel. 
Whenever guests check into a hotel, he/she has to make clear about the mode of payment at the time of registration. When the guest check-out of the hotel, they pay the bills by cash or credit card. 
The different methods of payment of bills are:
1. Cash
2. Credit card
3. Travelers cheque - It is a cheque issued by any bank to the travelers in exchange of the cash. It is another form of cash.
4. Company account or bill to company - The related company of a guest may pay the bills in this method.

üìù Notes:
Say:
For completing the registration process of for filling up a guest registration card or commonly known as reg card, other than personal information, two main documents are required by the law of government.
It is a two part process.
Collect information and documents from new guest or recheck of repeat guest, the details required for guest registration as per organization's standards and government rules
Cross check the identity document details of the guest. Verify the submitted documents with the original document.
Ensure all mandatory guest details are captured as per regulatory requirement.


Form C ‚Äì According to the registration of Foreigner‚Äôs Rule 1992, Rule 14, any Hotel/ Guest House/ Dharmashala/Individual House/ University/ Hospital/ Institute/ Others etc. who provide accommodation to foreigners must submit the details of the residing foreigner in Form C to the Registration authorities within 24 hours of the arrival of the foreigner at their premises. This will help the registration authorities in locating and tracking the foreigners. This form is sent to the nearest FRRO(Foreigner‚Äôs Regional Registration Office) or Local intelligence unit(LIU).

If incase the foreigner is from Pakistan, Bangladesh or China the Form C has to be submitted within 12 hours, and also to the local police station. The copy of the same is to be maintained as permanent records for the duration as specified in the law.

Next important document is Passport.
A passport is issued by the government to allow its citizen to travel abroad, facilitate their passage and provide protection. The front office associate should verify the passport of all foreign nationals at the time of registration.

This passport here if Mr. Bean. Do you want to see what happens when he goes to a hotel?

Step-4, Rooms Management

üìù Notes:
Say:
The last step of registration is Rooms Management.

What does it mean?
It means for how long the rooms will be occupied and when shall they be available for resale to the next guest. In other words, for how many days one guest is going to occupy the room for how many number of days. Rooms are the main source of business. And correct information on itinerary of rooms shall give a better view of booking the rooms and generating business for future.

After the registration process, the front office associate should:
Ensure guest details are recorded appropriately in the hotel system for future reference.
Ensure that late night registrations are handled as per company‚Äôs policy on customer facilitation, e.g., using handheld devices and without much delay to customer.

Activity-7, Case study -1, Role play

[[OCR Image Text: BLACKLISTED]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
These are some real life incidents in some of the hotels.
We will try to analyze the situation and come to a conclusion.
I want two volunteers who can come up here and perform a role play.

Case ‚Äì 
Mr. Sridhar is a walk in guest. He request a room for ten days. 
The front office associate checks and finds that he could get a room. However while processing the request he finds out that Mr. Sridhar is a black listed guest, as he had not paid the rent for the room on two occassions when he had stayed 2 years back in the hotel.
It is a slack period for the hotel and most of the rooms are vacant. Should the Front office associate accept or reject the reservation?

Allow 10 minutes for learners to rehearse on the role play. And give 15 minutes to act on the situation.

Reference point ‚Äì A black listed guest is never allowed to stay in the hotel again. No matter what. He can prove to be very harmful for the hotel. Learners are supposed to include this point in their play.
Appreciate the learners after the play is over.

Now lets all of us discuss a situation. It happens quite often in our hotels.
I want each of you to participate.
Allow 15 minutes for discussion. 
Time the activity totally for 30 minutes, that includes 15 minutes of debrief.

Raghu is a receptionist in a very famous hotel. One day a guest arrives at the front desk and enquires about the availability of the room for three nights. There are fifteen rooms available for the requested duration. However while talking with the guest, Raghu realizes that the guest is heavily drunk though he is behaving decently. What should Raghu do in this situation?

Debrief

Guest is intoxicated

Is he decent? Is he creating a nuisance or disturbance?

NO.
Register the guest privately. Take full payment in advance. Keep security in loop.

üìù Notes:
Say:
In situations like this you have to be very alert. The first step is to see if the guest is creating any nuisance because of his alcoholic intoxicated state.
If not then all the details should be carefully taken very firmly, yet politely. Ask the guest to come to a private place for registration so that other guests walking in the lobby are not able to see a drunk guest.
Inform your supervisor or duty manager.
Full payment in advance should also be taken from the guest. Security should kept informed of this guest.
The mode of payment should be completely in cash or credit card in advance.
If possible some contact number should be established that can be reached at the time of need.

üìù Notes:
Say:
In the last session we learnt how to record guest details for registration. Check in procedure is the next step of the guest cycle. In the session of registering guest details we learnt how to welcome a guest, take guest details and finally allot a room. These steps were pre check in arrivals. 

I would like 5 points from all of you which can summarise registration process briefly. It will be like a recap of the last session. 

Trainer‚Äôs note ‚Äì
Elicit and encourage learners to give few points from the session ‚Äì record registration details. Prompt the responses with questions like- 
Is it legally required?
Is it a paper/document or can be done online?
What are the steps for registration?

After the discussion proceed to debrief.

Debrief
The registration process begins when the guest arrives at the reception or the arrival section of the hotel. The process terminates when he has signed the registration card or guest arrival register, has been assigned a room and goes to his room.¬†It is a legal requirement that each guest must be registered. Guest signature is important as it signifies his consent to pay for all the services provided by the hotel and abide by the rules and regulations of the hotel. It also serves as a proof of his stay in the hotel from a certain date to another certain date. So in short, registration serves as legal contract between the hotel and the guest. We can summarize the objectives of the registration system as follows :1. To provide guest information to he hotel.2. To fulfill legal requirements.3. To provide mode of payment.4. To provide information about the date of departure.

Now let us see how do we follow up check in procedure after registration.

Eye for details

üìù Notes:
Say:
As a front office associate you have to have some specific skills and qualities. These qualities help you in handling a situation efficiently and effectively. Some people have these qualities by nature and some develop these skills. These skills will help you in growing as a person and along with the technical front office knowledge, you will have better prospects to grow in the company.
One of these qualities is eyes for details. It reflects on your observation power. It tells us how well can you analyze any situation, its surrounding and the steps to rectify it in a calm and patient manner.

In todays session we will play many games to develop these skills and to learn the tricks to achieve them efficiently. So shall we start?

üìù Notes:
Say:
The easiest way to start developing this skill is to start paying attention to our surroundings and routines.¬†¬†Playing spot-the-differences games where you are supposed to find the differences between two similar pictures. It‚Äôs one of the classic concentration games that kids and adults of all ages can play together. And I‚Äôm excited to show you this brand new spot-the-differences game.
Your task is to find ten differences among the two pictures as soon as possible. In your handbook you will find this activity. I will give you 15 minutes to finish this activity. When you spot a difference, encircle it with a pen. 
After you have finished the activity raise your hand, and tell me all the differences. I will write them on the white board here if it is correct.

If you manage to find all the differences in under 5 minutes, you are brilliant. If you do it in over 5 minutes, you are getting there, you will become brilliant!! Just remember you will definitely have brilliance skill, no matter what!
Note that any mistake you make or any hint you use will make you lose a couple of seconds.

Trainer‚Äôs instruction ‚Äì Students will do the activity in their handbooks. The student who would be leading in the activity will raise his/her hand first and announce that his activity is over. Appreciate the student on his presence of mind and quick problem solving qualities.

üìù Notes:
Say:
Similarly in hotel industry also you will be always under a magnifying glass. Your supervisors will be checking your actions. Your guests will be expecting a solution. You will get no extra time to think about a solution. You can always politely ask the guest to ‚Äòallow you time to get back to them‚Äô, however guest will be still waiting.
You will have to be quick, on the alert and right.
In days to come we will enact a lot of similar situations where you will be asked to derive a solution. You need to remember to have eye for details in the situation but quick.
Is this not exciting?

So lets see how these qualities help us when we are at the front desk.

Observe the background

üìù Notes:
Interactive session

Say:
Eye for detail is very important on a front desk in a hotel. In this picture we see a few things. They are there for a reason. Lets see how far can we see and imagine the reasons.
First let me ask a question.

Note - Elicit answers from the learners. Keep the interaction light and fun for about 15 minutes. Choose  learners at random. Encourage learners who have not spoken before to interact.

Ask:
What do you all see in this picture?
Wait for learners to answer.

Say:
Good. Now tell me the importance of each item.
Elicit answers again.

Say:
Superb effort. Now I will tell you my version.
We see a desk bell, a bunch of keys, a placard which says check in and some green plants and some red files in the background.
Therefore I think this is a front desk where the significance of the desk bell is to function like a calling bell. If incase a guest is waiting but however the front desk associate is busy else where he can ring this bell to gather attention. 
There is bunch of keys, which can be rooms or of the desk itself.
There is a placard of check-in, that means this is where the check-in of the rooms by the guest happens.
The green plants and red files are just to provide an attractive contrast to the picture or must be there on the table as center appointment. It signifies the front desk should be an attractive place and always organized.

Attention to detail and strong communication, organizational and interpersonal skills are important for Hotel Front Desk Agents.
We will now focus on the check-in placard for today‚Äôs session.

‚ÄòCHECK-IN‚Äô
We have heard this word a lot of times during our many sessions.
And we have an fair idea as to what it means. We check in on social media, or the restaurants or a local caf√© we go.

Ask:
Can anyone tell me if they have used any app to check in to a restaurant.
Encourage the learners to answer the question.

Say:
Great. In simple terms check in means to sign in. Anyone can sign or validate the fact that he/she was there, in the restaurant or the social media site.

Here we see check-in happening on Facebook, Twitter, Zomato, Foursquare.
Many of us must be using these sites for ordering food or connecting with friends. 
Similarly our guests also can leave their feedback about the experience in our hotels, both for room and stay on these social media sites, for their friends to see and follow.

Ask: Can you name some more social media platform where you must have seen check-ins?
Encourage learners to answer.
If they answer, applaud their effort. If not Then tell them the example of Tripadvisor where guests leave their feedback of their experience.

Say: 
Now we will understand what does Check in terms of hotel mean?

We will conduct this session with lots of activities and games. I will ensure you all that you will not get bored. 
Next activity is to put the steps in correct order.
I will distribute some papers which has some or other step in guest cycle. The step mentioned on the papers are also on the slide, but they are all jumbled up. 
You need to put them in order. Please volunteer to come up onto the stage and hold the paper in your hand as per the next step. At the end of the activity you all note down the steps in your student guide.
So let us proceed, shall we? 

Trainer‚Äôs note- Print the steps on a card or big A4 size paper. Randomly  distribute the cards to the learners. Ask the learners to stand in a queue with the correct card in their hands.

Check ‚Äì In in Hotels

üìù Notes:
Trainers note-
Animated slide

Say:
In this session, we will learn in details of how the check-in process actually happens in hotels.

At hotels or similar establishments, guests are usually required to check in (also called register or sign-in), which involves providing or confirming the guests' personal information and providing a signature. The laws of some countries require guests to sign a register (or a registration card) and some also require the provision of identification documents, such as a passport or drivers license, which the hotel can copy and retain for its records. Usually, only one guest per room is required to register. Sometimes, the register may need to be provided to a government agency, such as members of the police, sometimes with a court warrant or similar authority.

Let‚Äôs see how it happens.
Click one pic/step at a time.

Step 1. There is a lobby in a hotel with a clean front desk.
Step 2. A guest service agent who should be courteous and efficient.
Step 3. A guest, who comes to stay in your hotel.
Step 4. Ask: What do you think should be step 4?
Elicit answers from the learners. Applaud the learner who has answered correctly.
Step 4: The guest service agent should greet the guest and then register her.
Step 5: Now what should be the next step? 
Choose a learner at random to answer the question? If the learner has not answered pass the question to the next learner. Applaud the learner who has answered correctly.
Step 5: That is correct! Next step is to Allot the room as per the guests preference and give the keys.
Step 6: Now what should happen?
Elicit answers from the learners. Applaud the learner who has answered correctly.
Next step is to call the bell boy and ask for luggage assistance. Wish the guest a happy and pleasant stay.

Pause, and replay the slide for a revision.

Play the clip. Make sure the clip is separately saved in your system.
After the clip is over.

Say:
Was it not a very professionally done check in. Notice the way front desk associate communicated with the guest. Interaction is the key for a successful check-in. She was multi tasking. The check in process was fast while she was still having a continuous conversation with the guest. She offered the reg card while allotting the room in the hotel system. While checking the ID proof, she spoke about the place where guest was coming from. That is eye for observation.
Remember these small little points while engaging with a guest for a successful guest experience.

Guest interaction

Enhancing the guest experience
Increase guest loyalty 
Generate data on guest behavior ‚Äì guest history
Communication
Knowledge and practice
Manners and appearance
Approachable all the time

üìù Notes:
Say:
We spoke about interacting with the guest. How else can we know anything about the guest if we don‚Äôt speak with them. 
Guest interaction has numerous benefits, including enhancing the guest experience, increasing guest loyalty, & generating lots of data on guest behavior.
At the heart of customer service is communication, at all levels. We all should be calm, accommodating and supportive to all guests, at all times. 
We need to learn how to deal with both easy going and hard to deal with customers. 
After all, we don‚Äôt want to be caught off guard with a scenario that we may not be able to handle. Constant development of communication skills in this area should be a priority. Learning how to make these interactions positive is a skill and not a talent. This means that with knowledge and practice anyone can learn to how to create a favorable guest experience with even the most difficult guests.
Speaking of manners and appearance, your hotel staff should carry themselves in a way that makes them approachable at all times.

Scanty Baggage alert!!

üìù Notes:
Ask:
What do you understand by the word ‚ÄòScanty baggage‚Äô?

Possible answers
Little luggage
No luggage
Don‚Äôt know

Say:
A guest who arrives at the front desk requesting for accommodation and is carrying very little or no baggage is known as a ‚ÄòScanty Baggage Guest‚Äô. This guest is usually Walk-in Guest.
The bell boy carrying the luggage should report the same to the front desk.
The Duty manager should also be informed at the time of registration and advance payment should may be asked from the guest for the entire stay.
The front office assistant should imprint scanty baggage stamp on the guest registration card. 

Ask:
Now can someone tell me why should the bell boy alert front office if a guest is having scanty baggage? Why is it a threatening situation?
Elicit learners to guess the answers.

Say:
The term Scanty Baggage refers to a guest with hand baggage. Such guests are a threat as they may check-out of the hotel without paying their bill. 

Consider a guest Mr. Smith, who is travelling with just one small suitcase which maybe only having few papers and some basic necessities. His reservation is for 10 days. It would be little strange to imagine that Mr. Smith could manage 10 days in the hotel with such small amount of luggage. 
It arises suspicions. Hence his baggage is stamped as scanty baggage. There is a possibility that Mr. Smith might stay for say 2 nights and leave the hotel saying he is going out for dinner with friends, but never come back. There is also a possibility that his suitcase could be empty. So, he leaves his suitcase also back. Basically he has used the hotel room and its services for 2 nights and left the hotel without paying the bill. This guest is called a skipper.

There is one point to note here. Nowadays, FIT(Free independent travellers) prefer to travel light. That means they do not carry a lot of luggage. It is usually a back pack. These guests can also be categorized as guest with scanty baggage and need controlled monitoring on their activities.

In both the cases, all the departments where a possible sale can happen, a note must be sent. The note should mention that if Mr. Smith or FIT or any guest with scanty baggage uses the services of that department, the preferable mode of payment should be either cash or credit card. If the guests requests to put the charge on their account it should be informed to the guest in a very polite manner that they do not entertain credit for these services. However you may face difficult customers too who would not be willing to pay the bill at that moment but could be genuine guests.

Most hotels have a policy of taking an advance as a safeguard against skipping out of the hotel. The bell desk maintains a strict control of such guests with definite policies to guide them.¬†
Let us see how to handle scanty baggage guests.

Scanty Baggage Procedure

[[OCR Image Text: ¬© Preas Association‚Äô]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
As I said before there is always a policy in place for guests who have scanty baggage.

The bell boy informs the Bell Captain and front desk associate of a guest with scanty baggage.
The bell captain stamps ‚ÄòScanty Baggage‚Äô on the Guest Arrival Card and informs the lobby manager. 
The front desk associate stamps ‚ÄòScanty Baggage‚Äô on the Registration Card.
The front desk associate informs the lobby manager who has the following options for the guest:
To ask for the entire room charges in advance
To ask for a deposit that covers at least one night charge
To lower the house credit limit for bills in which the guest has to clear the bills periodically as he touches the limit.
This is normally done when guests check-in to the hotel for the first time. Regular guests known to the management may be excused from such policies. The Lobby Manager signs the registration card with his/her instructions.
The Bell Captain fills the Scanty Baggage Register and gets it signed by the Lobby manager.
Housekeeping and Security Departments are informed of the guest room number to keep a watch.

It is very important to monitor such guests.

Corporate Business Traveller

üìù Notes:
Business travellers belong to one particular company, visit your hotel many times in a year. They have a special rate called corporate rate. A Company volume guaranteed rate ( CVGR) letter is offered by the Hotel to a company to use the hotel services, and also to offer a special discounted rate for this high volume bookings agreed by this company.
Their room plans can also include meals and taxes. They do not have off-season and if hotels work hard to attract bookings and build loyalty, they can create a secure revenue stream for their property.
Their needs are often easier to narrow down and cater for. Booking process to be as fast and as simple as possible.¬†They have to be offered real time service. They do not have too much time in their hands. They like apps on their mobiles, hence if all the services of the hotel are provided through an app, they would really like it.
The purpose of their trip is usually very defined and specific, as is the time they will spend while staying at their destination. They travel usually for meetings.
Try building a relationship with an entire company, not just a single businessperson.¬†
Consider flexible check-in and check-out times. It‚Äôs a good idea because business travellers fly at all different times and may require additional time at the hotel.
Items like power outlets, desks, printers etc are essentials. You may also want to include a page on your website for ‚Äòbusiness amenities‚Äô.

It seems like they are the most targeted customer. And they constitute of maximum revenue of a hotel business.

Air India
Jet Airways
No Idea

Say: There a many flights that come in and go from Indian airports. Many of them have a contract with our hotels for their crew members accommodation.
Airline crew consist of the pilots and flight attendants. During the layover or before the next flight begins they visit our hotels and stay usually for a night. 

Ask:
What do you think is the most important priority of crew members.
Elicit learners to answer. Keep the discussion for 5 minutes.

Say: It was good to know about your knowledge on airline crews. ‚ÄòSleep‚Äô is the most important thing for a crew member.
Therefore location is of utmost importance. Do not allot a room that is near to the elevator as they may will feel the vibrations all night long. 
If the hotel has a disco, make sure you give a room at least two floors away.
Their sleep is very important for a safe flight next morning. Slumber kits containing earplugs and eye masks should be provided at turndown service.
Exclusive discount to Airline Staff for meals and bar.
There should be a team that is on duty 24/7 waiting to assist and provision for early morning breakfast for an early flight.¬†
Security of airline crews during their hotel stay is vital.
A shuttle service drops off the crew at the hotel at a scheduled time. The crew checks in and then go to their rooms and often order room service.
Guest room lists are not left in places that the general public can access.
The hotel is a safe heaven for airline crews and the only place to rest before embarking on their next flight.¬† Therefore, it is important the hotel takes all necessary steps to avoid any intrusion into the crew‚Äôs privacy and to prevent sabotage of flight plans.

These were the categories of guest with which we identify them in our hotels. All have specific needs and requirements. Basis the needs we should interact with them and provide rooms and service accordingly.

Debrief:
I will show you some pictures and you have to identify the category of guest.

Click to show the pictures.
Elicit answers after each picture. Describe the type of clothing, luggage or ethnicity of the guest used to identify the category of the guest.
Anticipate the number of guests in the second picture of Indian cricket team.

Say:
Lets see the answers. Click to reveal the answers.
The first picture is of a lady who is sitting alone and holding a map. It implies that she is travelling independently and not in a guided tour. Answer is Free individual traveller.
Second picture if Mr. Virat Kohli getting arrival welcome. He is in his uniform, so it should be anticipated that his team and coaches and other support must also be travelling with him. Hence this is a group of more than 5 people who have a planned schedule. Answer is Group inclusive traveller.
Third picture is of a pilot in uniform. Hence he is an airline crew member.


That was an interesting exercise for eye for detail. When we are at front desk we will have to try to identify the category of a guest even at a distance of 10ft away. We will have only few seconds before we engage in a conversation with the guest. Hence we should be able to judge the category of the guest by their physical appearance and luggage. This will help us in performing a faster and quicker registration and check in.

To revise the categories of guests are:
Domestic traveller
FIT(Free independent/ individual traveller)
GIT(Group inclusive traveller)
SIT(Special Interest Tours)
Corporate Business Traveller
Trade delegates/ Conference participants
Airline Crew

Once we have understood the various types and categories of guest, it will be easier for us to anticipate their needs.
Once we understand their needs , we can anticipate their preferences, engage in conversation with them for a positive experience.

Interacting with guest means better guest data, it gives you a better chance you discover more data on customer preferences.
Collect as much guest data as you can. This help you to formulate closer relationships with your guests.
You can use data to develop customized personalization

Some tips on engagement

Meeting room, airport shuttle, or restaurant reservation

Strategy to approach a guest based on cultural ethnicity

Offer services that will help such as a gym, spa, massage

Interact

Special request from guest

üìù Notes:
Say:
Some tips for you for your future guest interaction at the front desk:
Business travellers, especially are highly-dependent on their¬†mobile phones while checking their itinerary via their device. This is where you need to try to engage with them, on a personal level. Wait for guest to finish checking their phone activity.
Ask the corporate guest or the crew or the conference participant, if they need to reserve a meeting room, airport shuttle, or restaurant reservation.
Remember business guests are a market within a market. Is your guest Chinese business travellers, or American? Knowing this may change your strategy of approaching the guest.
Corporate travellers may not have the proper time to look after their health. You can offer services that will help such as a gym, spa, massage, or yoga. It will help in upselling more services of the hotel.
Interact with guest and identify the room preference based on type of room, room rate, days of stay, number of guests, gender of the guest, room view.
Make note of any special request from guest, e.g., related to specially abled(disability), non-smoking etc. Please note that we call disabled people as specially abled in a polite, polished manner.
And remember to be quicker at everything.

Check for guest room preference , 
Verifying reservation  details

[[OCR Image Text: ‚Äòa]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
This is the second part of check in after knowing the guest room preference and before finally allotting the room.
Check in procedure is a very complex procedure. It needs to be quick-no doubt!, yet it is an excellent opportunity for front office associate to negotiate revenue details. 
¬†
Instructions:
List the objectives for this session. Read from the slide.

Say:
This step of verifying reservation details can happen during the time of check in or during pre registration activities. The timing has to be important. Again a tired guest would not like to be bothered with these interaction points. We should be a keen observant to understand when to engage in interaction when it comes to revenue generation.

It is important to note here, along with good eye for observation, good memory is also important.

Suggest related-product sale that may
increase hotel's revenue

Upselling gives the hotel an opportunity to suggest additional services that will enhance the guest stay.

üìù Notes:
Trainers instruction ‚Äì engage in  interaction first and then move to reveal the slide.
Say:
That was an interesting and refreshing game. So now we know how is memory important, and we need to stay alert and sharp in every situation.

Now we are refreshed, so lets go to the next section.
The ultimate goal of any hotel is to have all of its rooms occupied, all year-round. While this is typically not possible, there are many ways hotels can plan to increase the room nights. Lets see some of them.

First I would like to know what do you understand by this section.

Possible answers:
I don‚Äôt know
Something that is done to increase the revenue.

Say:
It is good to know your thoughts on this chapter.
There are many services that are provided in the hotel. If we club some service with a room night, it may increase the revenue. Front desk is an excellent place to engage in a conversation with a guest to add value to their room and ultimately to the hotel‚Äôs revenue.
In simple terms we can call it a package deal. Changing how you sell your product can significantly boost your sales and revenues without requiring any changes to your marketing or pricing. 

Click to reveal the slide.
By the definition: upselling gives the hotel an opportunity to suggest additional services that will enhance the guest stay.
Sell extras like spa treatments or leisure activity at your hotel like sauna, bicycle ride etc. while taking a check-in.
Instead of merely handing a standard menu to guests, create customized menus with specialized offerings and pricing. Offer both ‚Äúpremium‚Äù and ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù drink options on beverage catering menus. 
Food and beverage: Try to encouraging guests to celebrate special occasion more often. Like birthdays, anniversaries. Decoration for birthdays, flowers, etc.
Transport ‚Äì arrange for local cabs, autos, hotel cars etc.
Event Add-Ons - Guests seeking information about booking events are ideal candidates for an upsell. Table centerpieces, audio-visual equipment, setup fees, room rentals and coat check room are all viable upselling opportunities.
Event promotion - Hotels sometimes use popular events, movies or other pop culture tie-ins to promote their rooms, special amenities or motivation for traveling in the first place.¬†For example a standup comedy or republic day parade.
Membership Rewards - Hotel chains often have membership programs. Loyalty is an important sales tool for hotels. If a hotel company can manage to create loyalty in its guests, they are likely to look for and use the same brand every time they travel, if not for the experience, then for the rewards they earn by doing so. Either way, the hotel wins.

Conclusion,¬†by knowing your guest and offering the right service to the right guest is the key to increase the guest satisfaction and hotel revenue. For the smaller hotel, it¬†can be challenging. However, there is a solution to this. The hotel can partner with¬†local service providers that support the guest‚Äôs interest. This will help hotel that has limited of additional service to earn more money. Remember, it is very important for the hotel¬†to provide the best service its guest. Contribute in achieving the hotel‚Äôs profit margin and consequently guest occupancy targets.

Guest discount

[[OCR Image Text: Opts
BARGAINING]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
As a part of check in there will be always someone who would be looking for a good deal. In simple terms  - discount.
Negotiating or bartering for a discount is commonplace in hotels, and no matter how good your rate is, there will always be someone looking for a deal.
So what happens when a guest asks for a discount?

The reason - People are always looking to save money. But saving money is not the only reason people ask for discounts. Although they may say it‚Äôs expensive you can ask them what they are comparing it too, it maybe that they have seen it at a lower price elsewhere.

Negotiate with guest when on discount requests.
Add or remove value to justify a discount. Like we understood in the last section, upsell by adding related product to the room.
Offer discounts for extended stays. Offer discounts within the limit advised by management, to retain the guest. The key is not to sell yourself short. Know the boundaries you are prepared to go up or down to as per the policy.
Some people are flexible with their travel schedule and might want to stay an extra night. If you offer them 50 percent off on the third night when they pay the regular rate for the first two nights, many will take the offer and you will generate incremental revenue.
Guests don‚Äôt want to hear that the front desk associate lacks the power to give a discount, they will simply ask to speak to the manager. In that case, call your manager.

üìù Notes:
Say:

I am to present a real life situation to you all, then guide you to solve the problem by providing  you all with a hands-on activity to learn the solution.
American philosopher John Dewey theorized that learning should be relevant and practical, not just passive and theoretical.

Confucius was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of Chinese history.  His philosophy emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity.  All the traits that are required by you as front office associates. 
In practical hotel life you will encounter lots of situations. Of which many would be pleasant and many would be not so pleasant. 
In the coming session we shall learn how to handle these situations. The following are the situations related to room allocation are in focus:
Upgrade
Downgrade 
Emergency situation

We will conduct role play for each situation. Here I must emphasize you all to listen the situation carefully, remember all the knowledge that we have learnt so far. And adapt the process to handle the situation.

Choose 2 volunteers. 
	One ‚Äì Guest
	Second ‚Äì Front office associate.
Allow 10 minutes for rehearsing a scene and dialogues and 10 minutes to act the scene. Help and guide the learners to formulate the situation if need be. If the first set of learners are unable to do so, then formulate another set. Trainer becomes the front office associate if need be and another learner as a guest. Keep an interaction session after each situation and ask the learners what was their understanding. Refer to the debrief part for the correct method of approaching the situation. Note that the theoretical brief to handle the situation is only for situational representation purpose and skill development. It is not to be considered as the only way to handle the situation. Add value to session by adding your own experiences and jokes.
Total time ‚Äì 10 minutes prep + 10 minutes act + 10 minutes interaction = total 30 minutes.

Say:
To understand the session of handling situations while allotting a room, we will conduct role play.
I would need 2 volunteers here with me for each situation. One will be a guest and the other will be a front office associate. 
I will give you 10 minutes to prep and rehearse the dialogues and 10 minutes to act. Remember to use all the knowledge that we have learnt so far. The learners in the audience shall not prompt during the role play. After the play is over I will ask you all what went right and what went wrong! I will be happy to share with you my experiences on the same while we go ahead on the situation.
Remember nothing is right or a wrong answer in handling any situation. The positive outcome of the situation, with a win win solution for both hotels and guests matter.

‚ÄòOnionize‚Äô to understand

Guest‚Äôs NEEDS

Guest‚Äôs WANTS

üìù Notes:
Say:
That was a brilliant effort.
To convert enquiries into sales successfully you must first get to the essence of your guest‚Äôs problem or needs.
You must understand all of your guest‚Äòs concerns, desires, fears, and limits. You cannot prescribe a solution until you diagnose their need. You cannot turn your customer‚Äôs need into a want until you know how to put value on your customer‚Äôs desired state. 
Just as you peel an onion layer by layer, so, too, you help your guest get to the ‚Äúheart of the matter.‚Äù
‚ÄúOnionizing‚Äù is similar to being an investigative reporter, detective, psychiatrist, doctor, and archaeologist. 
You ask, probe, dig, diagnose, and listen to understand ‚Ä¶ then prescribe the solution and win the sale!

You have to remember to create irresistible offers and then follow up with them, constantly.
I have a sample script here which can help you in understanding the situation in a better way.

FOA: Sir, I would like to inform you that it is a very busy period during that time. We would be having quite a number of wedding groups. Our room prices are slightly higher than you may have thought. Will that be okay?

This situation is a tricky situation. Lets see how to handle it.

Guest who had been shifted to other hotels is known as ‚ÄòWalked Guests‚Äô.
Hotels usually accepts more reservations / overbook than the number of rooms available. This is to compensate the no-show, cancellation  and early departure statistics.
When an unanticipated number guest stay-overs occur and the hotel is not able to accommodate all the guest expected to arrive that day then that results in a walk situation.

‚ÄòWalk‚Äô a guest - process

üìù Notes:
Say:
When a walk situation occurs, the following procedure is to be followed:
The Front Office Manager should review all arrivals and decide which guests should be protected from a potential walk situation (i.e., Frequent Guests, VVIP guests. All Group / conference guest arrivals should be reviewed. Many groups guarantee payment. 
Ensure that a senior member of the Front Office management team and Duty Manager / lobby manger is aware of the situation and readily available to personally handle relations with all guests to be walked.
When the guest who is supposed to be walked arrives at the hotel, both the situation and the alternate arrangement which is done should be carefully explained. As the situation is explained, the guest should receive a sincere apology on behalf of the hotel.
Once the guest understands the situation, they should be asked if they have a preference in alternate hotels in that area. If so, make arrangements for the guest at that hotel, if available. Local room availability should be determined before the "walked guest" arrives.
If the guest does not have transportation, we should arrange transportation to and from the alternate hotel, using our hotel vehicle, or taxi, if necessary hotel should also pay for these transportation costs.

What do you do after eating a delicious meal in any restaurant?

Engage in discussion with the learners for about 5 minutes.

Say:
You must be washing your hands. 
Then asking for a bill. 
Then must be checking the bill and verifying the items on the bill, if you have consumed or not.
Sometimes some restaurants charge you for mineral water extra, if you have ordered and consumed.
You check the GST, VAT or the service tax.
You pay the bill. You keep the receipt.
The cashier gives you mouth freshener. 
You smile. Cashier smiles and says good bye. Thank you.

The way you pay the bill in the restaurant and leave from their, similarly the last interaction of the guest with the hotel staff takes place at the time of check out. Only difference is it is more polished and professional.

During check out the guest does the following activities:
Formally vacate the room,
Settle their bills,
Leave the hotel.

At this stage if there is any dispute at all it can ruin the guests complete experience.

üìù Notes:

On the other hand, a smooth settlement of bills would enhance the guest experience. The speed and accuracy is of prime importance here. Error free billing and speedy processing of the check out requests reflects the professionalism and service level of the hotel.
It leaves a lasting impression on the guest and guarantees a repeat business.

The FO performs at least 3 important functions during the checkout and settlement process.
It resolves outstanding guest account balances.
It updates room status information.
It creates guest history records.

Reviews like these are put on social media sites ‚Äì like Facebook, trip advisor etc. People can see these reviews and formulate an opinion about the hotel even before seeing it. It surely leaves a bad taste in the mouth.

üìù Notes:
Say:
There is a hotel.
And there is a guest. Guest arrives at the hotel. 
Hotel creates one account for the guest. 
Guest account is guest folio.

Guest account settlement depends on effective FO accounting system that maintains :
accurate guest folios, 
verifies and authorizes a method of settlement and 
resolves discrepancies in account balances. 

Hotels find it most effective to settle a guest account while the guest is still in the hotel. 
Guest can settle the bill by paying cash, charging the balance to a credit card, deferring payment to an approved direct billing entity(bill to company) or using a combination of payment methods. 
FO should verify or confirm guest credit card or direct billing information before he/she arrives at the desk for check out. 
Pre settlement verification activities ensure that the hotel will be paid for accommodation and services.

At the time of check out, front office informs housekeeping and all points if sales(POS) to rush the last credit transaction so that the cashier can add them to the guest folio.

üìù Notes:
Say:
On parallel lines there are various activities that are happening during the check out of any one guest. It is because we need it to be fast and efficient.

1) At the Bell Desk:
During checkout a luggage out-pass has to be obtained from the cashier stating that the guest has settled his account and returned the room key.
Once this is received a departure errand card is made and filled out by the bell boy and will got to the guest room to bring down the luggage.
The bell captain will also make an entry regarding this in the bell captain‚Äôs book.
On reaching the guest room the bell boy will announce himself, knock on the door enter the room on gaining permission. The bellboy will also ensure the
following:
1. Collect room keys from the guest
2. Check the room for any possible damage to the property.
3. Draws the curtains, locks the balcony.
4. Checks bathroom and fittings.
5. The guest is escorted by him to the front desk
6. He puts a ‚Äúroom to be cleaned tag‚Äù card on the door after switching of the lights and air conditioner.

The departure room is then inspected by a housekeeping supervisor/ Room attendant to ensure that nothing is left behind by the guest. The housekeeping/ In room dining department will also check the minibar for anything consumed by the guest to be charged to the bill.

At the lobby the bell boy will:
Keep the guest‚Äôs luggage at the bell desk. Put hotel stickers and mark the luggage with ‚ÄúD‚Äù indicating departure luggage.
Collect the luggage out clearance slip from the reception and loads the luggage in the car/taxi.
Return the errand card to the bell captain which will then be entered onto the bell captain‚Äôs control sheet.

2) At the Reception desk:
The Front desk receptionist checks the list of expected checkouts for the day and will confirm with the guest his date and time of checkout.
Departure notification slips or DNS are printed to inform the other departments of the guest‚Äôs checkout.
Checking for the mail messages and faxes is done for the guest. Also checking for safe deposit box or in room safe keys is checked for one last time.

3) At the cashier‚Äôs desk, the following is happening:
Verifying account information.
Posting any remaining charges to the guest‚Äôs folio.
Presenting the guest folio.
Verifying the method of payment.
Processing the account payment.
Updating the room status.

The procedures used will vary among Front Offices depending upon hotels level of service and degree of automation. Some Front Offices offer automated or express check out.

Guest used minibar after informing front desk about check out. What happens now?

‚Äπ#‚Ä∫

Imagine a situation

Can anyone tell me what do you understand by late check out?

üìù Notes:
Say:
It is very difficult to get payment for unpaid bills after the guest has checked out. The guest might refuse to pay any charges after they have checked out. Hotel should ensure that all transactions have been billed to the guest at the time of account settlement.
It is at this point that the cashier will check if any late-out check out charge is applicable or not. 

Ask:
Can anyone tell me what do you understand by late check out?
Elicit answers from the learners. Discuss for 10 minutes.

An example of late check out ‚Äì Say if the check out time of the hotel is 12 noon and the guest checks out at 06:00 PM, they might be charged late check out as per the policy. 
Guests do not always check out by the hotels posted check out time. To minimize late check outs, the front office should post check out time notices in visible places such as back of the guest room door, FO, in departure material etc. some hotels charge late check out fee. 
Explain to the guest why the fee is charged (management policy, HK can prepare room for other guests arriving that day).

‚Äπ#‚Ä∫

Late charges

üìù Notes:
Ask:
Can anyone tell me some other examples of late charges at the last minute.
Elicit answers from the learners. Discuss for 10 minutes.

Very good effort. Some examples are :
Laundry bills,
Telephone bills,
Breakfast bills for the last day,
Minibar consumption.

LATE CHARGES may be a major concern in guest account settlement. Restaurant, telephone, room service charges etc are the examples of some potential late charges. Sometimes additional cost of postage, stationary, labor, etc is more than the late charge itself. 

FOLLOWING STEPS CAN BE TAKEN TO REDUCE LATE CHARGES: 
Front office can post transactional vouchers as soon as they arrive at the front desk to the guest folio. 
Ask departing guests whether they have incurred any charge purchase or long distance calls that do not appear on the folio. 
Front office computer system that interfaces or is in direct connection with revenue center outlets like coffee shop or restaurants or spa is often the most effective means of reducing or even eliminating late charges. This means as soon as a purchased is made in any outlet for dining or leisure, the executive will post it in their POS and it will directly reflect into the front office system.

Departure procedure

üìù Notes:
Read from the slide.
Say:
(Read step number 4 marked with a star)
At the step where the cashier presents the bill to the guest, the cashier yet again confirms the mode of payment with the guest.
Should it be the same as that the guest had given at the time of check-in, cashier can take the amount payable. However if the guest changes the mode of payment to card or cash alternatively, the cashier will be required to make the necessary changes in the system and process the adjusted payment before settling the account.

üìù Notes:
Say:
GROUP DEPARTURE: 
At the Bell desk: 
Sufficient number of bell boys are arranged to handle luggage of the group. 
Baggage down time and wake up calls times are important and must be checked and followed strictly.
Allocate floors and rooms to bell boys to bring down the luggage down to the lobby. If on the day of departure the guests are not in the room the bell boys go to each group member‚Äôs rooms and ‚Äúpull‚Äù each group members baggage out of the room and bring it down to the lobby until the group is ready to leave. This process is called as ‚Äúbag pull‚Äù.
Baggage is brought down to the lobby and counted. Bell captain obtains a baggage out-pass. 
Room keys are handed to reception.
After clearance from the cashier and reception finally the baggage is loaded onto the vehicle by the bellboys. 

At the reception: 
Departure notification slips are issued half an hour prior to actual departure by the receptionist to telephones, housekeeping, room service, and food and beverage etc. to avoid any late charges. 

At the cashier: 
Cashier prints out the master folio and individual folios {if any}.
Makes a room wise summary for easy collection.

Guest‚Äôs transaction credit
Guests weekly bill, long staying guest
House bank
Transfer guest balances
Paid out vouchers 
Handle cash, credit card, traveller‚Äôs cheque
Authenticate the currency 
Exchange foreign currency

The major duties and responsibilities of a cashier are:
Prepare bills  and present the same at the time of a guest‚Äôs departure.
Upgrade guest‚Äôs transaction credit on a daily basis.
Maintaining guests weekly bill, for a long staying guest.
Obtain the house bank and keep it balanced. (We have discussed before)
Can anyone tell me what is a house bank? 
Elicit answer from the learners. Engage in discussion for 10 minutes, then proceed to say.

Say:
House bank ‚Äì is a fixed amount which comprises currency and coins of different denomination to carry out the day‚Äôs work.

Now continuing on the other responsibilities of a cashier,
Transfer guest balances to other accounts as required.
Handle paid out vouchers of guests.
Settle guest accounts by accepting cash, credit card, traveller‚Äôs cheque, etc.
Check the authenticity of the currency received.
Exchange foreign currency according to the daily exchange rate in strict accordance with RBI.

Balance

Settlement payment

Reduce Advance Payment from the final invoice

üìù Notes:
Say:
In hotel accounting system you will have to debit and credit lot of entries. 
But the most basic for a front office associate is to balance the invoice as per the advance payment made if any.
In simple language, the amount to be paid by the guest at the settlement should be equal to the amount that comes from deducting amount paid in advance from the final bill.

Activity ‚Äì 1, Balancing

Advance Payment		4000
Food at the restaurant	1500
Room rent per night		1500
Coupon Discount		2000

Guest stays at a hotel for 3 nights
Calculate the final amount to be paid at the time of check out?
All in INR

TOTAL 	= 1500 + 4500 ‚Äì 4000 ‚Äì 2000
	=   Rupees 0/-

Reduce from total bill = (-)4000
Add = + 1500

Considering the guest wants to settle the bill in cash.

Ask:
What is the answer?
Select learners at random to answer the question.

An invoice is a commercial document that itemizes a transaction between a buyer and a seller. 
If GOODS OR SERVICES were purchased on credit, the invoice usually specifies the terms of the deal, and provide information on the available methods of payment. An invoice is also known as a bill or sales invoice.

What is an Invoice?

üìù Notes:
An invoice is a commercial document that itemizes a transaction between a buyer and a seller. If goods or services were purchased on credit, the invoice usually specifies the terms of the deal, and provide information on the available methods of payment. An invoice is also known as a bill or sales invoice.

In hotel management the buyer is the guest and the seller is the hotel.
Can anyone tell me what are the goods and services in this case?
Elicit answers from the learners. Select learners who have not participated before to answer the question.

That‚Äôs correct, in the hotels the guest pay for the rooms and facilities provided in the hotel. So goods are rooms, dining and other facilities.

Traditionally at check out guest is presented a final copy of his/her account folio for review and settlement. This final copy is an sales invoice or bill.

üìù Notes:
Say:
In hotels, FOA should confirm how the guest intends to settle the account at the time of registration or check in.
Guest may establish credit by presenting a credit card. 
Guest may choose to settle his/her bill by cash, debit card, travelers cheques or personal cheques.
VIP or special guests or corporate accounts should not be asked for settlement if their account is marked that all charges are to be Direct Billed or billed to their company. 
Because of internet we have many more options too now a days. Such as ‚Äì NEFT (Internet transfer), Paytm.
At the end of a check out Cashier should bring the guest account balance to zero, called zeroing out. 
When guest pays by cash or credit card, hotels assume that the payment is full and close the folio.
If the account is to be paid through Direct Billing by the hotel, it must be transferred to the city ledger and billed through the account receivable system. And hence the account is not brought to a zero balance in this particular mode. 

We will learn these in detail now in coming slides.

Cash/Debit payment in full ‚Äì zeroing out

Zero  amount in the folio

üìù Notes:
Do not reveal the slide in the beginning.
Say:
Cash payment in full at check out will bring a guest account balance to zero. It is the most convenient mode of payment.
Considering that guest must have paid some cash in advance,
If there is a credit balance in the guest folio, then the hotel will pay the balance amount to the guest.
If there is a debit amount in the guest account the guest will pay the remaining balance to the hotel.
The guest can choose to pay by a debit card too.
A cash receipt, bill or invoice has to be issued to the guest by the cashier. The cashier should mark the folio as paid. 

Explain the slide as below. Click to reveal the slide.
Guest folio is opened at the front desk. It has zero rupees as the amount.
Guest stays in the hotel. Room revenue is added in the guest folio.
Guest checks out.
For settlement of bill she chooses to pay by cash or card.
Guest folio again goes back to zero.
This process is called ‚Äòzeroing out‚Äô.

Now, a situation, where the guest had mentioned at the time of check-in, that he/she would pay by credit card. And at the time of check out he pays the bill in cash.
What will you do? Will you charge the guest twice?
Let the learns answer the question.

Possible answer: No 
Surely you cant charge the guest twice.

If the guest has produced a credit card at check in, the cashier should destroy the guest credit card details that was noted at registration at the time when the guest pays the account in full with cash.

Traveler‚Äôs cheques are issued by banks and avoid the risk of carrying cash. Guests can also use traveler‚Äôs cheques to settle their bills. 
At the time of settlement the cashier should confirm the identity of the guest from the safety and security point of view. Also there is no danger of them being stolen as they can be encashed only when the signature of the holder matches with the signature signed at the time of issue. A foreign traveler‚Äôs cheque  should be treated as foreign currency and the necessary records, statements and certificates must be maintained like in the case of foreign currency and should be sent to the Reserve Bank of India.

Credit card transfer

üìù Notes:
Say:
Even though credit card transfer settlement brings a guest account to zero, the amount of the charge must be tracked until payment is actually received from the credit card Company.
Credit card settlement creates a transfer of credit on the guest folio and moves an account balance from the guest ledger to a credit card account in the city ledger (non- guest ledger). 
Guest signature on the statement generated by the credit card swiping machine completes this transaction. In some hotels computer system sends the settlement transactions directly to the credit card company. Guest only signs on the voucher present at FO. When foreign guests pay by credit card, credit card company payment is in local bank or currency. 

In simple terms, the issuers of the card(Bank) assures the seller(hotel) that the owner of the card(guest) has a satisfactory credit rating and the bank will see to it that the hotel receives payment for the service delivered.

üìù Notes:
Say:
Let us an example. It is yet another incident that happened recently in a very famous hotel. It was a comedy of errors. It means one error led to another.

Meet Mr. Ashok Kumar. Not to be confused with ‚Ä¶ Mr. Ashok Kumar.
Pause here for a moment. Then proceed to say.

The first Ashok Kumar lives in Mumbai, where he works as a manager for an export company. But when he checked into the this very famous hotel, he found that the hotel had confused him with another guest that happened to share his name. Hence there were two Ashok Kumar in the hotel at the same time.
First, he was issued the keys to a room on the executive floor that was already occupied, presumably by the other Ashok Kumar. He was reassigned to another room, eventually. 
When he checked out, he was surprised to discover someone else had already paid for his stay. The bill was made out for Ashok Kumar from Lucknow and was to be charged to his American Express card.

An you see what happened here. The other Ashok Kumar paid the bill of this Ashok Kumar from Mumbai. And because it was a credit card payment it will involve a big complex procedure to refund the money to the Ashok Kumar from Lucknow.

Practice with every learner. Form a set of two learners. First learner to act as a guest. Second learner to act as a cashier. The guest is supposed to give credit card as mode of payment. The cashier is supposed to receive the card, swipe it through the machine (fictitious), generate a receipt in two copies- customer and merchant. Cashier is supposed to return the card in card holder of folder with a pen for guest to sign. Cashier is then supposed to take the folder back with merchant‚Äôs copy and if possible the pen too, using both hands.

Say:
We will now have a role play. This role play is demonstrate the part where the exchange of credit/debit card happens at the cashier of front desk. The guest gives the card for settlement. Now how should you use the card and give it back to the guest? In how much time period? These two points are very important part of transactions. The one thing to note is your body language and hand gestures.

Direct Billing or Bill to Company

Responsibility of collecting revenue lies with the hotel
Approved by hotel‚Äôs credit department.
Guest signs the and does not pay the bill.
VIPs, corporates

üìù Notes:
Say:
Like credit card settlement, direct billing transfers a guest account balance from the guest ledger to the city ledger. Unlike credit card settlement responsibility for billing and collecting a direct billing lies with the hotel rather than an outside agency. Billing should be arranged and approved by hotel‚Äôs credit department. Guest signs the folio and accepts the responsibility to pay the bill should direct billing account not pay the bill.

This is usually done in case of VIPs, corporates where the instruction is bill to be sent to company.

Bill to company
The reservation is made by the company on behalf of the travelling executives. The executives carry a letter or reference authorised email  from their company stating the terms and conditions of their stay and modes of payment as bill to be sent to their company for only a particular set of service incurred. It also serves as their identity proof. Sometimes the executives or guests utilize facilities like laundry or minibar that are not included in terms and conditions of bill to company. In that case the company executive have to bear the expense themselves and settle in full payment at the time of check out.

Combined settlement method

üìù Notes:
Say:
A guest may elect to use more than one settlement method to bring the folio balance to zero.
Example a guest may make partial cash payment and charge the reminder of the account balance to an acceptable credit card. FOA must accurately record the combined settlement methods and take care that all required paper work is properly completed. Once the guest has settled the account the FOA should provide the guest with a copy of the folio and the total invoice. Good evaluation and follow up should be there as it is the last chance to make a lasting impression.

CHECK-OUT

| The Square

_‚Äî_]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
Advanced technology has helped with facilitate special guest service such as - expedite departure activities.
They are of two types ‚Äì Express Check out and Self Check Out.
 
Express check out ‚Äì
 Guests may encounter a long line at front desk when checking out during the peak hours (e.g., between 7.30 and 9.30 am). To ease front desk volume, some FO initiate check out activity before the guest is actually ready to leave. A common pre departure activity involves producing and distributing guest folios along with the express checkout voucher to guests expected to check out. FO, HK or Security staff can quietly slip the folio and the form into the guestroom, while they go for their rounds. By completing such a form, guest authorizes the front office to transfer his or her outstanding folio to the credit card voucher created during registration. The final bill along with the receipt is emailed to the guest. The bill and the credit card details is sent to the credit company for collecting the revenue towards the guest.

An ECO rooms list should be printed every morning which is necessary for monitoring the entire system. The second copy of this list is given to the bell desk. This system is available only for credit card paying guests and is a facility given to those guests who avoid going physically to the cashier‚Äôs desk at the time of check out for considerable time saving.

Now lets see what is a self check out option.

Check out options ‚Äì Self Check out

üìù Notes:
Say:
Self check out ‚Äì
In some hotels guests can check themselves out of the hotel by accessing self check out terminals in the lobby or in room system interfaced with front office computer intended to reduce check out time and front desk traffic. Some resemble automatic bank teller machines while others posses video and audio capability. Credit card has to be used (number or magnetic strip). Check out is complete when the guest‚Äôs balance is transferred to a credit card account and an itemized account statement is printed and dispersed to the guest. This system sends an updated room status to front office computer. In room folio review and check out usually relies on an in room television or guestroom telephone access via an in room TV. Guests can pick up a printed folio at the front desk on his way out. In room self check out automatically updates room status and creates Guest History records. Another advantage is guests can look at their folios at any time during their stay.

Unpaid account balances

üìù Notes:
Say:
No matter how carefully the front office monitors guest‚Äôs stay there is always possibility that the guest will leave without settling his account. Guest may forget to check out or front office may discover late charges for a guest who has already checked out. After departure charges or outstanding balances represent unpaid account balances.

There are occasions when a guest‚Äôs financial transactions are not properly posted in the guest folio.

Read from the slide. Then proceed to Ask.

Ask:
What is the difference in both the amount.
Pause. Allow the learners to answer.

Say:
That‚Äôs correct. It is a matter of one decimal. This one point can create a huge dispute in accounting system and even bigger dissatisfaction to the guest.
So whose mistake is that? 
This situation is a typical example of improper posting of charges. The final bill is inaccurate.
Sometimes it is because of human error and sometimes because of the system. This could lead to a dispute with a guest and delay other guests in the queue. This is to be avoided at all costs. If such a situation occurs, you must apologize profusely and escalate the matter to your manager.

Engage in a discussion for about 15 minutes, then proceed to say:

Say:
Once the guest is ready for departure after all the financial formalities, we have to update the front office records.

Front office records
Guest folios
Registration card file
Guest history card

Front office usually makes two copies of each guest account folio.
1st copy ‚Äì guest receipt
2nd copy ‚Äì hotels permanent record
Front office that sometimes uses three part folio, file the third copy with credit card voucher or direct billing statement in case the guest later needs a summary of charges.
Registration cards are filed alphabetically whereas guest folios are filed numerically according to the room number.

Updating Guest History Cards
Front office management can better understand its clientele and determine guest trends when it develops and maintains a guest history file. It contains personal and financial data of the guest hence it is confidential and proprietary. It is the last step in check out and account settlement. Many hotels build guest history cards from expired registration cards. It has information about the guest‚Äôs spouse, family etc. the information may help develop advertisement that appeal to the types of clientele the hotel is attempting to attract. Guest histories may also point out the need for new, supplementary or enhanced services.

Lets play a famous game. Dumb charades.
I will ask all of you to form 2 groups. We all know the rules of this game, but I will still tell them once more.
I will give the names of 3 Bollywood movies to each team. One team member from each team will come in front here on the stage and act on the movie‚Äôs name. Remember you cannot speak or say anything. That learner‚Äôs team has to guess the name of the movie. I will allow 3 minutes to each movie name to be acted upon. 
If the team is not able to guess the name of the movie then I will tell you the answer. Then we will proceed to the next movie name and next learner from the second team. Shall we start?

Trainers note ‚Äì
Form 2 groups. Give one movie name at a time to each learner and then give the next movie name to the second team. Time the activity for 3 minutes each, total activity 20 minutes.

So how did we start communicating as human beings?
History of communication says that people have been sharing ideas, views, feelings, information, knowledge, facts, and values with each other from the beginning of human civilization.
In ancient age, humans were communicating with each other by the use of symbols, actions, and gestures before by the use of symbols, actions and gestures, much before they established languages for both oral and written script.

Isn‚Äôt it amazing that without a script, language and dialogues, people would communicate with each other.

Say:
But when you are in real life situation in a hotel, you will not be allowed to use your phone, whatsapp or facebook in guest area.
So how will you communicate?

Let‚Äôs play an activity.
I want to volunteers here with me.
I will give you 2 chits. You have to enact the role mentioned in two chits. But you cannot tell each other before the activity starts.
I will give you 5 minutes to do the activity. So lets start. I will tell you the rules of this activity individually here with me. So let‚Äôs start. Shall we?

Trainer‚Äôs note ‚Äì
This activity is to demonstrate the importance of communication and its reason for being there in any civilization.
Ask 2 volunteers to come up on the stage with you. Individually hand over 1 chit each to the learners.
Tell the rules to each of the two volunteer one at a time.
Chit 1 ‚Äì Learner is a guest who has approached the hotel lobby. He meets the front office associate(learner 2) and wishes to register. He is unaware of learners 2 rule of not speaking.
Chit 2 ‚Äì Learner is the front office associate at the lobby. He sees the guest approaching to the lobby desk. He also sees that a big giant cockroach is on the guest‚Äôs coats. But the learner cannot speak or write to tell the guest that there is cockroach on the coat. The guest is not aware. How will the front office associate proceed? 
Time the activity for 5 minutes. Anticipate funny gestures or sounds. Keep the atmosphere lightly humored.
The rules of this activity are that both the learners cannot speak or write to interact to each other.
Once the activity or time is over, proceed to debrief.

Debrief:
In this activity I had given 2 role plays to these learners. They did a brilliant job. But did anyone of you understood what just happened here between these two learners.
Elicit answers from the rest of the audience. If someone is able to match with the following debrief as an answer, appreciate the learner greatly. Else continue to say.
Chit 1/ Learner 1 ‚Äì Was a guest who has approached the hotel lobby. He meets the front office associate(learner 2) and wishes to register.
Chit 2/ Learner 2 ‚Äì Was the front office associate at the lobby. He sees the guest approaching to the lobby desk. He also sees that a big giant cockroach is on the guest‚Äôs coats. But the learner cannot speak or write to tell the guest that there is cockroach on the coat. The guest is not aware. How will the front office associate proceed? 
Pause for a moment.
Over here I gave a message to both of them but I did not give them a medium to share their ideas. I practically stopped them to interact with each other. In a way the rest of the class was also not told about the situation. In short, it was a chaos. Isn‚Äôt it?
If only there was some mean to tell the guest that there is cockroach on their coat, it would saved us so much drama. That ‚Äòmean or medium‚Äô is communication. Communication between guest and the associate. And also communication between me and rest of the class, in this case.

Healthy communication in the organization fosters mutual trust and sense of cooperation among the staff members and the guests as well as between the staff members and the management body. Front office communication with other departments can make or break the guests‚Äô stay at the hotel.
As the front office is responsible to sell the hotel accommodations, it is a major driving force for generating revenue. Hence, communication within and out of front office department needs to be vibrant and positive. Hotels that communicate better, sell better.

Definition - Communication

Oxford Dictionary says communication is
 ‚Äòthe activity or the process of expressing 
ideas and feelings or,
of giving people information‚Äô

Newstorm and Davis (1997), author of book ‚Äì Human behaviour, 
defines communication as 
‚Äòthe transfer of information from one person to another person. It is a way of reaching others by transmitting 
ideas, facts, thoughts, feelings and values.‚Äô

üìù Notes:
Say:
The word communication is derived from a Latin word ‚Äòcommunicare‚Äô. It means to impart, share or make common. The process of sharing views, ideas, knowledge between two individuals or between group is known as communication.

From both the definitions, we have understood that there are three things in common in both the definitions.
There are always two parties (individuals/group) ‚Äì One is a sender, one is a receiver.
There is always something to transfer ‚Äì ideas, feelings, knowledge, information etc.
There is always a medium to transfer the information  -  written, verbal, non ‚Äì verbal.

The last thing to remember is that the message should be correctly interpreted and understood. Lastly it should have some kind of feedback or acknowledgment. The message should motivate a response from the receiver.

This flowchart summarizes the very basic communication cycle. There will be many more combinations and variants that will develop according to the situation. As I said before, the communication cycle begins with the sender. There is always a message which goes through a medium, to the receiver. The receiver then sends a feedback to the sender.

Front office interacts with various departments since the guest inquire about reservation through the entire guest cycle up to the guest‚Äôs departure.

Communication with Human Resource ‚àí Front Office department is engaged with the HR department to interview associates, help shortlist them, and select the most eligible employees. It also contacts the HR department for employee training and induction programs, salaries, leaves, dues, and appraisals.

Communication with Accounts ‚àí As front office department handles guest accounts with a complete responsibility, the staff needs to often interact with the back-office accounting colleagues regarding payment settlements or dues of guests or non-guests, discount offers, and coupons settlement. 

Communication with Marketing and Sales Department¬†‚àí Sales and Marketing department highly relies upon front office inputs about the guests. The guest history compiled by the front office department is an excellent source for segmenting the guests, prepare guest-oriented packages, and plan and execute the campaigns.

Marketing and Sales

Food and Beverage, Banquets

Housekeeping

FRONT OFFICE DEPARTMENT

üìù Notes:
Say:
The next two departments are most closely associated departments with front office.

Communication with Food and Beverage Department¬†‚àí 
Since front office department is the one where the guests speak about their food and beverage requirements during reservation, the front office needs to communicate with the food and beverage sections frequently.
It also keeps the track of guest‚Äôs purchases from the restaurant, the bar, or coffee shops in the hotel.
It conveys special requests of the guest regarding food and beverage to the F&B department.
It deals, accepts, and reserves banquet inquiries and coordinates them with the respective departments.

Communication with Housekeeping¬†‚àí 
The front office staff needs to interact with the housekeeping department on the concerns such as ‚àí
Readiness of vacated accommodation for selling.
Guest‚Äôs complaints and requirements about any amenities is reported at the front desk. Front desk usually telephones housekeeping staff members when they receive special requests.
Guest‚Äôs requirement of removing soiled dishes or linen from the room.
In addition, the housekeeping department relies upon front office staff for the number of rooms sold, departures, walk-ins, stay-over guests, and no-shows. Timely distribution of the room sales helps the housekeeping manager to plan employee roster, personal leaves and vacations. Most hotels have Property management system that can communicate room status through workstations and mobile devices used by house keeping.

Odd cupboard items ‚Äì Front desk agents and GSA‚Äôs should have alternate ways of meeting guest requests when the department that normally handles the request is closed or inaccessible(i.e. agents may be given access to housekeeping supplies during late ‚Äìnight hours). Rollaway beds/cribs, additional linens/pillows, additional clothes hangers, audiovisual and office equipment, special equipment for guests with disabilities, Vanity items like ‚Äì hair oil, shaving cream, Razor, After shave lotion are few examples of odd cupboard items.

Communication with Banqueting¬†‚àí 
The front office and banqueting department needs to interact with each other on the concerns such as ‚àí
Expected number of guests to attend the banquet. This gives an idea about the busy period in lobby where all the banquet guests would be coming in together.
Showing directions of the venue to the unfamiliar banquet guests.
Posting of daily messages on display board regarding venue, occasion, hosts and guests.

Communication with engineering and maintenance - 
If maintenance problem makes a room unsalable, the engineering department should be reported immediately. Then housekeeping staff must be informed directly after the problem is resolved so the room can be readied for sale and back in rooms inventory.

Can anyone tell me what will be the status of the room in that case in the PMS. We have learnt about it in room status terminology. I will give you a hint. It is the same letter three times.
Elicit answer from the learners. Appreciate the learner who has answered correctly.

The answer is OOO or out of order room. It will not be counted in that days room inventory as it is not saleable.

Communication importance ‚Äì case history

üìù Notes:
Say:
We will see an interesting case history here.
Let‚Äôs suppose a guest, Ms. Patel walks into your hotel lobby. You are busy speaking on phone and ignore her.
What do you think this behavior is considered?
Polite or Rude?

Elicit answers from the learners.
Rude, right? 

Now lets see a follow up situation. She had mentioned while making  a reservation that she would like a local Gujarati paper early in the morning, and the reservation associate had promised the same. In the guest‚Äôs room the newspaper was delivered late on the next morning. 
What do you think how will be your experience?
Elicit answers from the learners.

I am sure it is a negative experience for the guest.

Next Ms. Patel orders breakfast in her room. But it was very busy that day. All the rooms were occupied. The breakfast order got delayed. She called the front desk to express her disappointment. 
Now what do you think how she feels?
Elicit answers from the learners.

Many of you are right that she must be feeling very angry by now. The damage is done. 
From the point where the front desk associate ignored her when she arrived at the hotel lobby, to delay in newspaper and then delay in breakfast, it has spoiled the guest‚Äôs experience ands she must have made a negative opinion for the hotel.
The proper way to deal with this situation is to smile at the guest as they walk-in and convey to them that you would be with them in a moment. And ensure that you attend to them in less than a minute. They should be seated in the lobby, while serving them a refreshing welcome drink and maybe cold towels. This gesture would put the guests at ease while they wait to check into their room. Thus, making effective indirect communicating with the guests is very important to satisfy and please the guest.  
Lets see how does it go in a lobby.

External ‚Äì Communication with the guests, vendors, government agencies, licensing authorities, banks, customs, travel agents, suppliers etc.
Internal ‚Äì Communication within the various departments in the hotel.

‚Äπ#‚Ä∫

Hotel Communication ‚Äì 
Internal and External

üìù Notes:
Say:
The hotel employees must present a professional, positive image to guests in all of its communication.
When answering a telephone, staff members should provide a warm and informative greeting to callers, introducing themselves and asking how can they help.
In face to face communication, associates should include appropriate body language and eye contact along with their use of professional language, tone of voice and conduct.

External communication can be defined as Communication with the guests, vendors, government agencies, licensing authorities, banks, customs, travel agents, suppliers etc.
Internal communication is the communication within the various departments in the hotel.

We saw an example of both external and internal communication in the previous sessions. 
External communication with the guest ‚Äì Ms. Patel.

Ask:
Can anyone tell me in the situation before, exactly how many departments were involved?
Elicit answers from the learners. This step is to revise and gauge the learners if they are paying attention.

Say:
Internal communication with Food and Beverage, bell boy and House keeping department.

Internal communication within the various departments is equally important in hotel for proper planning and execution of tasks. Within the department, the staff of front office communicate with each other to provide the best possible guest services such as reserving accommodations, registering guests, managing guest accounts, handling guest mails, and personalized guest services. In addition, the front office through the property management system (PMS) compiles the guest‚Äôs charges from food, beverage, room service, laundry/valet, gift shops, telecommunication, business center, valet parking, health and recreational facilities and banquets or catering on a daily basis.

In the previous case, while the guest is waiting for the check in process, Food and beverage department should be informed to present the welcome drink and cool towels to the guest.

üìù Notes:
Say:
The lobby situation mentioned before has 4 departments which were involved in the internal communication process.
Front office associate informs food and beverage service to tend to the guest in the lobby.
Food and beverage service informs food and beverage production to make the welcome drink. 
Food and beverage requisite cool towels from housekeeping and keep it ready in a presentable tray to offer to the guest.
The last 2 steps are done sometime in advance to cut short on communication process and give a quick guest experience as soon as they walk in.

The front office communicates with housekeeping department the most. Housekeeping department is provided with day‚Äôs arrival details ‚Äì time of arrival, VIP status, group or crew information, any special requests etc.

But this time you have to do it right. Do remember the points from the previous slide. Inform food and beverage service for providing welcome drink and cool towels to the guest while the guest is waiting in the lobby. Let us start.

Trainer‚Äôs note ‚Äì 
Refer the script below and the reference material in the slide above. Time the activity for 20 minutes. Allow the learners to practice for 10 minutes and act for 10 minutes. If they are not able to perform as per the required standard, then volunteer yourself to act as the front office associate and act the same situation. When the play is over, appreciate the efforts of the learners and transit to the next slide.

Scene 1
Ms. Patel walks into your hotel lobby. 

FOA in on the phone. Smile, make an eye contact and gesture or speak very softly 
FOA:  I would be with you in a moment ma'am.
Ms. Patel: That‚Äôs fine. I will be waiting on the couch in the lobby.
FOA should return to Ms. Patel in less than a minute.
Simultaneously inform an Food and Beverage associate to offer a welcome drink to Ms. Patel. At this point F&B associate should also offer mildly fragrant cool towel.  The tray should be neat and clean.
F & B: Namaste ma'am. May I please interest you in a refreshing tender coconut water(or any other drink). You must have had a long journey. 
Ms. Patel: Yes, sure. Thank you very much. I just needed that. It is indeed very hot outside.
FOA should have walked upto Ms. Patel by this time.
FOA: Namaste madam. Welcome to ABC hotel. I apologize profusely for not being able to attend to you before at the front desk as it was a very unavoidable urgent call. How may I help you?
Ms. Patel : That‚Äôs ok. I am sure it must have been an important call. I am Ms. Patel. I would like to check in. I have made a reservation for 3 nights for a single room. Can you please look into that.
FOA: Sure Ms. Patel. I will surely check your reservation details. May I please request you to kindly come along with me to the check in counter to fill up the registration formalities. Meanwhile if you would like can my colleague offer you a fresh cool towel to beat the heat that was outside. (Gesturing towards the F & B associate).
Ms. Patel: Sure. Why not. But can this registration process be hurried up. I have a meeting with someone in the next 30 minutes.
FOA: I assure you it will only take a couple of minutes.
Escort Ms. Patel to the check in counter.
FOA: Ms. Patel, I see your reservation is confirmed for 3 nights. (Offer the reg card here with a pen that is open and ready to use.)
I have a beautiful garden facing room on the 5th floor.  It overlooks our garden of roses. In the morning it is a pleasant sight. Can I please ask for some identity proof while I confirm the room?
The small conversation should happen while filling up the reg card. The guest should not be kept waiting as she already mentioned that she is in a hurry.
Ms. Patel: Sure, here is my driving license. Will that do?
FOA: Driving license is perfect. I see you are travelling from Gujarat. It is a beautiful modern city.
Ms. Patel: Can I also please request you to provide a Guajarati newspaper in the morning. Will you be having those.
FOA: Ms. Patel, we do have English, Hindi and the local language national newspaper that is supplied to every guest room. I will definitely put in a request to get a Gujarati newspaper also to be given in your room. 
Hand over the room key.
FOA: Ms. Patel here are your room keys. You are in room number 535 on the fifth floor. The elevators are on the right. I will ask a bell boy to escort you to your room and assist you with the luggage. My name is (____). I am at the front desk. You may dial ‚Äò9‚Äô and ask for me for anything that may need or require. It will be my pleasure to assist you. Have a pleasant stay with us at ABC Hotel. Have a good day ahead.
Gesture the bell boy to assist Ms. Patel with the luggage and escort her to the room.
Ms. Patel: Thank you and have a good day you too.

Scene 2

Ms. Patel had mentioned that she would like a local Gujarati paper early in the morning, and the front office associate had promised the same. In the guest‚Äôs room the newspaper was delivered late on the next morning. 
Ms. Patel dials 9, calls for the (___) ‚Äì Front office associate.
FOA: Namaste Ms. Patel. This is (_____), from the front desk. How may I assist you?
Ms. Patel: Hi. If you remember I mentioned yesterday while checking in that I would like a Gujarati newspaper in the morning. But today there isn't any Gujarati newspaper. What happened? 
FOA: I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience MS. Patel. I understand that the Gujarati newspaper is of utmost importance to you in the morning. Due to some logistics difficulty we were unable to procure the Gujarati newspaper from our supplier. Please allow me time for another 2 hours. I am trying to arrange the newspaper from another supplier who has promised me that he would deliver the newspaper in the next one hour. Post which I will have the newspaper delivered to your room at the earliest. I assure you that I will do best in my capability to get a Guajarati newspaper to you today as promised.
Ms. Patel: Ok. I shall wait. 
FOA: Thank you very much Ms. Patel. While the newspaper comes to your room, would like to place an order for breakfast in your room. I can take the order and inform the room service to serve the breakfast in your room at the earliest.
Ms. Patel: That‚Äôs a good idea. I can have my breakfast by then.
FOA: Sure ma'am. Would you like to have (_____), tea/coffee/ juice?
Ms. Patel: Gives the order.
FOA: Ms. Patel, I will convey the order to room service. It usually takes about 15 minutes for food to be delivered to the room. I will put in a note to serve you breakfast at the earliest. 
Ms. Patel: Thank you.
FOA: The pleasure is mine ma'am. Is there anything I can assist you with?
Ms. Patel: No, that will be all.
FOA: Have a nice day ahead ma'am. And hope you enjoy your breakfast. Good bye.
Ms. Patel. Bye. 


Ask:
Now what do you think how she feels?
Elicit answers from the learners.

Say:
She must be feeling little reassured by now. Her needs were considered and acknowledged. There was a delay in delivering the guest request but the front office associate made a direct contact with the guest, interacted and tried to handle the situation. At this point FOA should ensure that the Gujarati newspaper is delivered to her room within the promised time. Also FOA should call Room service, place the breakfast order, inform room service department that already guests request was not met due to some difficulty. Room service and other departments like house keeping and laundry should be notified to handle the guest with extra care to eliminate a further chance of dissonance or guest complaint.
After about half an hour the FOA should call Ms. Patel to check on her breakfast experience and if she would like any other assistance.

Now this is how an effective chain of communication takes place.

The Seven C‚Äôs

7 C‚Äôs of Communication

Complete ‚Äì Relevant necessary details.
Concise ‚Äì Short notes, professional.
Considerate ‚Äì Guest should get the best, without asking.
Concrete ‚Äì Specific information.
Clear ‚Äì Close ended communication, no gap.
Courteous ‚Äì Polite.
Correct ‚Äì Imparts understanding of the message.

üìù Notes:
Say:
The various aspects of communication can be categorized into 7 C‚Äôs.
A thread of communication should always have:
Completeness: The sender and receiver should exchange all the relevant necessary details. For example in the first example all the details were complete- like guest name, room type, arrival details etc.
Conciseness: The hotel representative should note down the information in concise, brisk and professional manner.
Consideration: The hotel staff should be considerate towards the guest. For example, A guest should be given a room with a good view if available without having the guest ask for it.
Concreteness: The information gathered should be concrete and specific. It should not be like ‚Äòreserve a room in December‚Äô, which does not specify stay dates.
Clarity: The message should be clear and should not have any communication gaps.
Courtesy: Always a courteous polite behaviour should be maintained at all time. With both internal and external guests.
Correctness: While taking a message, the receiver should ensure that the details are absolutely correct. This removes the possibility of doubt at any other time. Repeat the message at the end to showcase that you have understood the message correctly.

Say:
Words are the most common symbols of communication. Oral communication describes any type of interaction that makes use of spoken words. It is either done in person ‚Äì face to face, or telephonically or through webcam. The communication is easy, effective and produces instant feedback from the receiver‚Äôs side.

BUT did you

LISTEN?

üìù Notes:
Say:
Two very important aspect of language and actions are ‚Äì listening and speaking.
Listening can be defined as a process of receiving, interpreting and reacting to a message received from a speaker.
However hearing and listening are not the same.

Ask:
Can anyone tell me how is listening and hearing different from each other?
Engage in discussion for 15 minutes, then proceed to say.

Say:
Hearing is solely dependent on ears and is a physical act. It is without deliberate effort.
Listening requires voluntary attention and then making sense of what was heard. It depends upon the attitude of the receiver..
While you are working in hotel front office, listening skills will be used in various situations. It maybe while you are handling special requests, complaints, taking instructions from your superiors, during staff briefings etc. You can anticipate the mood of the other person by listening to them carefully.

Written communication

INR 1,49,75,497 approximately

Letters, e-mails, circulars, memos, reports, note, manuals, in house hotel magazine

üìù Notes:
Say:
Remember when we used to hand write things? Such as¬†cards, and homework, and essays?
The importance of handwriting wasn‚Äôt even in question, it was a necessary means to an end. I remember in college my biggest struggle during finals was that my hand would cramp up from all the endless essay writing. I also remember my lecture notes were the most popular to copy because they were so visually appealing, with graphics and block letters, and bullet points.
We wrote with a pen or pencil. And didn‚Äôt think twice about it. Handwriting was a key component of how we communicated.
But now‚Ä¶.the importance of handwriting for mere communication has lost its place. We don‚Äôt need it as much anymore.
Take a moment to think about when the last time was you actually hand wrote something‚Äîother than an address on an envelope, or maybe a quick scribble.

The golden age of ink pens started in the 1920‚Äôs, when pens became works of art and treasured status symbols. Nowadays people even walk around with a pen. 

Ask:
Can anyone guess the price for this pen? It is a limited edition, the Boehme Papillion Pen is available in white, yellow or rose-colored gold, and encrusted with more than 1,400 diamonds and sapphires that reach the internal spring mechanism. There is a design of Butterfly that grace the cap and body while the distinctive Montblanc diamond is featured at the top.

Click to reveal the content.
Written communication may be in form of letters, e-mails, circulars, memos, reports, note, manuals, in house hotel magazine, etc.
The plus of written communication is like it ensures authenticity, transparency, mass access, proof for future reference, legal paperwork and are permanent record.
The negatives of written communication is it requires high cost factor for print material, unnecessary paper work, no immediate response, limited reach (only to the literate world).

A hotel has to correspond in writing with its guests, other hotels, suppliers, bankers and other service partners. Business letters or emails are an important tool of written communication which reaches to the neighborhood, in other cities, nationwide and on an international platform.

Say:
Doodling means to draw pictures or patterns, basically symbols while thinking about something, or noting some message or when you just scribble when you are bored. 
In real life, we may get a phone call. It might be a busy lobby time. You may just want to scribble the information on a piece of paper at that moment in a hurry. And you see a paper in front of you which is of no use.

What will you do?
Possible answers
Will write the message from the telephone on that paper.

Say:
That is right. That is what most of you will do. You will simply write the information on that paper to remember the message.

But what happens,
When you have to give the same message as a handover to your colleague in the next shift.
Or if you lose that paper somewhere and not able to find.
Or if the scribbling part may not be sensible to everyone at all time but only to you.
 
Now will that scribbled paper help?
Possible answer : No

Case history

‚ÄúThe quality of food and service in the restaurant is not up to the mark. There was also a manager that was speaking in a very high tone and in abusive language to his junior service staff. You should really take care of such things.‚Äù

üìù Notes:
Say:
In a recent event a case happened. A guest dined in a Asian cuisine fine dining restaurant in a 5 star hotel. He paid the bill and he left the restaurant. Next day in the hotel morning meeting, the general manager of the hotel asked the food and beverage manager and the chef what was the complaint in the Asian restaurant last night. But both the chef and the F & B manager were unaware of any such complaint. 
On investigating further they found out that a guest has mentioned his dissonance in the log book of the duty manager. While leaving the hotel he wrote his experience comments in the log book.
It said ‚Äúthe quality of food and service in the restaurant is not up to the mark. There was also a manager that was speaking in a very high tone and in abusive language to his junior service staff. You should really take care of such things.‚Äù

Now will this customer ever come back to dine in the restaurant again?

Possible answer: no

There you lose a valuable customer. And even worse a situation can be when this guest goes and tells this incident to his friends and family and they chose not to dine in this Asian restaurant again. It will generate loss in revenue. Isn‚Äôt it?

Now I will tell you, what happened after that.

The chef and the F & B manager found his contact details along with the written comment in the log book. They called the guest and apologized for the dissonance that was experienced. They invited the guest one more time to visit their restaurant where they would serve food of the guest‚Äôs liking. They told him that a special menu will be cooked only for him as per his preference. They also ensured that the bill will be taken care of the hotel.(This is because they are entitled to give discounts to guest as per the policy). They also promised to take disciplinary action and impart training to the manager and his junior who were talking in a loud and inappropriate language.

The guest was now little happy that he and his feedback was given importance. He promised to come back again.
This process of handling a complaint and making efforts to change the guests negative feelings into a positive experience is called service recovery. This was only possible because of the log book kept at the duty manager‚Äôs desk. 
Duty manager at the beginning of the shift should overlook all the comments in the log book and inform the respective departments with the necessary details for a positive guest experience.

Non verbal communication

It conveys meaning of a spoken word and occurs unconsciously. Other factors that play an important role in non verbal communication include personal appearance, posture, gestures, eye contact, personal space and voice.

ACTION speaks louder than words!!!

üìù Notes:
Say:
We can communicate without words too. Non verbal communication refers to the messages we give and receive through body language and facial expressions. Interestingly emojis or emoticons (emotion icons) were made by referring to facial expressions.

Activity -7, Power of body language

üìù Notes:
Say:
Body language speaks louder than any words you can ever utter. Whether you‚Äôre telling people that you love them, you‚Äôre angry with them, or don‚Äôt care less about them, your body movements reveal your thoughts, moods, and attitudes. Both consciously and sub-consciously your body tells observers what‚Äôs really going on with you. We will play an interesting game to understand the power of body language.

Trainer‚Äôs note ‚Äì 
Time¬†the activity for¬†10 minutes.
Instructions and set up :
1.¬†Explain to the group that you are going to give them a series of instructions, which you would like them to copy as fast as they can.
2.¬†State the following actions as YOU do them:
‚Ä¢¬†Put your hand to your nose‚Ä¢¬†Clap your hands‚Ä¢¬†Stand up‚Ä¢¬†Touch your shoulder‚Ä¢¬†Sit down‚Ä¢¬†Stamp your foot‚Ä¢¬†Cross your arms‚Ä¢¬†Put your hand to your mouth ‚Äì¬†BUT WHILE SAYING THIS PUT YOUR HAND TO YOUR NOSE

3.¬†Observe the number of group members who copy what you did rather than what you said.
¬†
Debrief
What's the point from this activity ?¬†
Facilitate discussion on how body language can reinforce verbal communication, however it can also be stronger than verbal communication ‚Äì it is important that we are aware of our body language in order to ensure we are projecting the right positivemessage.

Ask:
If you have to voluntarily go and talk to these people, will you talk to them?
Elicit answers from learners.

Say:
Similarly when at the front desk, if you have body language and facial expressions like the above ‚Äì bored, angry, un-interested, you will be communicating a negative message to the approaching guest. You are indirectly saying ‚Äì ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk to you.‚Äù
After this do you think the guest will approach you. 
My guess is ‚ÄòNO‚Äô!
There, by doing this we lost a customer and hotel revenue.
Hence we should be always careful of what body language we are presenting in the public area and to the guests.

Effective leadership and

üìù Notes:
https://www.mindjet.com/blog/2013/03/communication-information-overload/

Say:
Therefor to enlist the importance of communication we can say:
Planning: To plan the staff roster and day‚Äôs activities. Arrival reports are required for organizing staff briefings.
Decision making: Many important decisions are made with the help of information available about the guest, rooms or hotel in overall points. All the available options should be studied carefully before suggesting a suitable alternative to the guest.
Coordination: Front office coordinates with various departments like housekeeping, food and beverage, sales and marketing, IT, accounts, Human resource to bring about a flawless guest experience.
Delegation: It is important to communicate the delegation of authority to all concerned persons. For example if FOM has delegated the task of making the duty roaster to any shift supervisor, then the same should be communicated to all concerned for better efficiency and implementation.
Employee Moral and Job satisfaction: It generates open and free communication, without any barrier between the FOM and his/her team member. This results in better morale and confidence of the team.
Effective leadership and better understanding amongst the team.

These points lead to increased productivity and revenue too.

Reasons ‚Äì Guest experience

üìù Notes:
Say:
The details that goes into the right side  blank is generally one of these six reasons. These 6 reasons give you the experience that you look for in your regular life from the 5 places that you visit often.

Fast - First, you may go back somewhere because it's fast. Fast food is an example. You may say, "I don't want to sit down. I just want to get my food and leave. That's all I want. I don't want anything. I just want a fast service." So you go back to a place because it's fast.
Quality - Quality of the dress is better in this material or fabric. You may say, "The quality is better, and I'm willing to spend more money, but I go back for quality."
Cheap - Third, a  reason you go back again and again could be because it's cheap or gives value for money. You may say, "Hey, I go to Big bazar because Big bazar has everyday low prices. It gives the best value for money, that's where I want to go to buy my groceries."
Luxury - Next, you may go back somewhere again and again because of luxury. You may say, "I've been buying branded clothes all my life because it's a luxury. Or, I like to go to this 5 star restaurant because it's luxury."
User Friendly - Something is user-friendly. "I go back to this place, it's so easy. This website is one I go back to because it's so easy to use. I like to use this app because it's so easy to use.‚Äú Ola is complicated, Uber is better. Hence Uber is user friendly.
Guest Service ‚Äì Some places may say they have the best guest service. Like Maruti or Samsung showroom.

Say:
In the previous modules we learnt about registration process and then arrival-check in process. The third stage in a guest cycle is guest stay.  Once the guest stays in the hotel, they avail various services and facilities by the hotel.
This stage is very crucial as the guest‚Äôs experience is important in generating repeat business and positive word of mouth or oral communication publicity. 
Guest service is when you have guests, of course!
You're trying to make your guests as comfortable and happy as possible. You're also trying to meet their needs and expectations, and solve any problems or situations that they might have. 
Therefore when you are serving a guest in a personalized and warm manner while exceeding their expectations is called guest service.

Incoming mails ‚Äì Mails that are received by the hotel on behalf of its staff and guests.
Out going mails ‚Äì Mails which are sent by the hotel staff and the guests.

[[OCR Image Text: Kap

üìù Notes:
Say:
When guests are away from home, they need a contact address where they can receive their urgent mails, calls, taxes or faxes.
For a long staying guest, they rely upon front office department for their mail and packages to be delivered quickly and efficiently.

Mails can be categorized into 2 categories:
Incoming mails ‚Äì Mails that are received by the hotel on behalf of its staff and guests.
Out going mails ‚Äì Mails which are sent by the hotel staff and the guests.

Further incoming mails have different procedures that are followed for various categories of guest. 

All mails are time stamped  with date at the time of receiving them.
Sort the mails as hotel mails and guest mails.
Further sort hotel mails into office mails and employee mails.
Send employee mails to time office for delivering to the concerned employee.
Deliver the official mails to the concerned office.
Send guest mails to the information desk.
The information associate will further sort the mails into : Resident guest, Checked out guest, Registered guest(Guest with confirmed reservation in future dates).
Registered guests: The guest should be promptly notified as per their arrival about the arrival of their mail.
Guest due to check-in: The mail should be held until the guest checks in, with a note made of the same on the guest‚Äôs reservation record.
Guests who have checked out: Mail should be returned to their senders, or to a forwarding address if the guest left one with the hotel.

Sometimes a mail or packages need a signature upon delivery. In many cases only the guest can receive the delivery, in which case the guest must be contacted. If not found guest should be notified that a delivery attempt was made. In normal cases hotel management allows the hotel staff to receive the delivery in guests absence on guest‚Äôs behalf.
Guests may also receive registered letters, express packages, and other mail requiring signature. If the hotel permits the front desk agent to sign for such mail after doing so the agent typically records the items delivered in the front office mail signature book. The guest would also sign for the mail in the book at the time of pickup or delivery. Packages are typically handled as mail. If the package is too large to store at the front desk, it would be taken to a secure room. The package and its location should be recorded in the front office mail signature book.
Hotel keep a record of all mails received at the mail receiving desk or bell desk or staff gate in a mail log book.

If a guest wants to send any personal mails, the hotel provides the service of collecting the mails from the guest room and posting them through concierge. The charges for the service are added to the guest account.

In a recent event Ms Kusum was staying in one very renowned hotel in Madhya Pradesh. In her reg card, her address was mentioned that of Hyderabad. She checked out on 19th March 2018. But on 20th March 2018, a courier arrived for her at the front desk. As per the procedure the courier was received. The FOA also noticed that ‚ÄòURGENT‚Äô was written on the courier parcel.
With presence of mind he pulled out the reg card of Ms. Kusum and sent the courier to her Hyderabad address. She was elated to receive the courier. She did not imagine that it was possible for her to receive the courier once she checks out from Madhya Pradesh. But this incident of the hotel associate sending the courier to her Hyderabad address made her over joyed and in a way a very loyal customer to the company in the coming future.

Now is that not an example of creating a memorable guest experience. I say it is simply wonderful.

üìù Notes:
Say:
At times there are telephone calls or visitors for a resident guest when she is not present in the hotel. In such situations, the front desk agents take the message for the guest and deliver the same as soon as the guest comes back.  The process of receiving and delivering messages handling, the prompt and timely delivery of messages to guest reflects the degree of professionalism of the front desk employees. 

The message slip is prepared in duplicate ‚Äì the original copy is placed in the log book and the second copy is placed in a message envelope slip. It is then slipped through the door of the guest room by a bell boy. 

Ask:
Can anyone tell me why is the message prepared in duplicate?
Elicit answers.

Say:
The purpose of preparing the message slip in duplicate is to ensure the delivery to the guest. If incase the guest misplaces the message, then there is always one more copy of the message to refer to.

If a resident guest is expecting a call or a visitor during her absence, they may leave a location slip(which similar to a message slip but is in a different format).In such case, the front desk assistant follows the instructions of the guest on receiving the telephone call or visitor for that guest.

Voicemail Box

üìù Notes:
http://app.kiwi/apk/com.metropcs.service.vvm/Visual-Voicemail-by-MetroPCS

Say:
In automated hotels nowadays, in addition it is very common for a hotel to provide its guests with a voice mailbox. Voice mailboxes are devices which can record messages for guests. There is button on the guest telephone that flashes a light. The light indicates that there is a message waiting for the guest at the front desk. The guest simply has to call the front desk to ask for the message.
Alternatively, a caller wishing to leave a message for a guest simply speaks into the phone; his or her message is then recorded by the voice mailbox system. To retrieve the message, the guest typically dials a special telephone number which connects to the voice mailbox.

Ask:
Imagine a situation if a person is calling for a guest who is of Korean nationality. The caller is also from Korea. You are on the front desk who receives the call. The person calling does not know how to speak English or Hindi, but only knows Korean language. The guest with whom he wants to speak is also not in his room. How will you handle this situation? How will you take the message for the Korean guest staying in the hotel?
Generate response from the learners.

Say:
A key advantage of voice mail is that the message is captured in the caller‚Äôs voice. This may be very important when the caller does not speak the local language clearly. So Korean caller is connected to the guest‚Äôs room telephone where he can leave the message in the language that she/he is convenient to speak in.

Say:
Facsimiles are fax copies in a simpler language. It is  another form of communication handled by the front office, should be treated like mail, but with special care. Since guests are typically waiting for these documents, special handling is required. If an incoming fax has special delivery instructions, such as deliver immediately to a specific room, the front desk must be prepared to dispatch a member of the bell staff with the fax right away. Typically the front office maintains a fax log or combined fax and mail log for tracking purposes.

Wake-up services are a key communication and guest satisfier. Very often a component of the hotel‚Äôs property management system can be programmed to receive and place the calls and play a recorded wake-up message. However, many hotels still prefer that the front desk agents or hotel operator place wake-up calls.¬†
The wake up call request is entered in the wake up call register.

üìù Notes:
http://www.seoandsmoservices.com/2018/02/09/proactive-vs-reactive/

Say: 
So now the question becomes, the difference between guest service and guest experience. Aren't they the same thing?
Elicit learners to answer. Time for 5 minutes then proceed to say.

Say:
Absolutely not.
Why? Let me explain. And I'll simplify it for you and it will stay in your mind.

Reactive v/s. Proactive
Think about guest service as reactive. And think about guest experience as proactive.
Here's an example of guest service. You call a customer service of your phone‚Äôs network. 
They say 
"Thank you for calling ABC tel. 
How may I help you? 
Yes, great. Are there any other issues that you have? 
Have I fulfilled the service request you had today? 
Okay, great. Please take this survey we have going on." 
This approach is reactive.

Guest service could be when a client is upset, you handle it, you react, you solve. 
With guest service you say few common predictable things like:
Thank you
Please
May I please put you on hold?
Thank you for understanding.
I totally understand where you're coming from. I totally feel your pain. I'm sorry.
It's guest service, because it's reacting to something, right?
And by the way, guest service is very important.

Guest Experience

With guest experience, we can ask :
‚ÄúHow is your day going?‚Äù
Or when you see a loyalty programme holding guest you may say something like, ‚Äú Thank you for your loyalty. I can see you've been with us for ten years. We appreciate your trust in us.‚Äù

The more you treat people properly, the more they will tell everybody, and your business gets stronger.

[[OCR Image Text: SL]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
Now few companies are very good at guest experience.

Can anyone make a guess what is a guest experience?
Elicit learners to answer the question. Then proceed to say.

Say:
Let me explain what I mean by guest experience. 
For example in any hotel you have more than 100 guests, you definitely have some VIP loyal guests.
Credit cards have VIP platinum card holders, American Express Black Card is a VIP card and Amazon Prime are all examples of VIP guest members. 

Our goal should be to move as many people as possible from guest service to loyal section which happens through guest experience.
Guest Experience is Proactive. It's all about details.¬†Running an extra mile for the guest is required to be pre-emptive or pre- reactive. You as front office associate should take few initiatives yourself to make the guest experience much more happily memorable. 

Let us see some examples;
With guest experience, we can ask : ‚ÄúHow is your day going?‚Äù

Mrs. And Mr. Kapoor

Mrs. And Mr. Kapoor

After Rajasthani Lunch, they found this surprise in the hotel room

[[OCR Image Text: ¬£5 RRR]]

üìù Notes:
https://www.myflowertree.com/mango-tango-4087

Say:
I will give you an example of a positive guest experience. But you have to help me while I am telling you this story.
I need you to tell me what will you do in the place of the front desk associate here.

So there was an old couple, Mr. and Mrs. Kapoor, who were staying in this 5 star hotel. While making a reservation the Mr. Kapoor had mentioned that on the second day of their stay it is Mrs. Kapoor‚Äôs birthday and they would like to go out for lunch to a nearby famous local Rajasthani restaurant. When the reservation associate was making the booking, she made a note of the same. This note was then passed onto the guest folio.

On that said day, when Mr. and Mrs. Kapoor came down to the coffee shop for breakfast the hostess wished Mrs. Kapoor ‚Äì Happy Birthday.

Ask:
Can anyone tell me how did the hostess come to know that it was Mrs. Kapoor‚Äôs birthday that day?
Elicit answers.

Say:
Front desk associate read the note on the guest folio, which mentioned the date of Mrs. Kapoor‚Äôs birthday. This front desk associate then informed F& B department and House keeping of the same. So when the hostess was seating the couple for breakfast she saw the note on her system along with the room number, and then she wished her.
I am sure Mrs. Kapoor must have felt wow.

Now when they were leaving for the Rajasthani restauarant to have lunch, the front desk associate again wished Mrs. Kapoor ‚Äì Happy Birthday.
At this point Mr. Kapoor was very happy and he mentioned that his wife really likes mangoes and they will have a refreshing aam panna in the restaurant for lunch. They were looking forward to it.

Ask:
Now if you are that front desk associate, what will you do with tis information? How will you wow the guest within your capacity?
Engage in discussion for 10 minutes. Write down the points given by the learners on a white board.

Say:
Click to reveal the slide.
In this case the front desk associate communicated with the bakery department and got a mango cake ready for Mrs. Kapoor as she likes mango very much. Then he asked the housekeeping to place a pretty bouquet of flowers in their room along with a Happy birthday greeting card.
When Mrs. And Mr. Kapoor came back to their after lunch, they saw this surprise and were very very happy. 

Front office team had just given them a very memorable positive guest experience.

That was a brilliant team work I must say.

Steps to create fantastic guest experience

üìù Notes:
Say:
To summaries the responsibility of front desk associate for creating a fantastic guest experience is as follows:
Ask for and anticipate any requirement from guest during check in.
Arrange for materials / consumables as required by the guest. For example guest needs certain medicine or stationary.
Coordinate with different department such as housekeeping, food & beverage, to fulfill guest requirement.

Guest dissonance

[[OCR Image Text: \]]

üìù Notes:
https://www.mapcommunications.com/blog/unhappy-customers-are-killing-your-business/

Say:
Guest dissonance means guest complaints or some reason due to which a guest is unhappy. When guests are not satisfied with some services and express their discontent to hotel employees, most often to the front desk staff, their grievances are recorded as guest complaints.
There are many different problems that a guest might have while staying in the hotel.

Ask:
What are some examples of some problems? Can you think of anything, a problem a guest might have? 
Engage in discussion for 15 minutes.

Say:
A guest may be unhappy because they are charged extra for not using any mentioned service on their bill.
They can be very unhappy because the Wi-Fi isn't working or their bed's uncomfortable. 

We will see the different complaints that can be broadly categorized into 4 types.

Categories of guest complaints

üìù Notes:
https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shower-mistakes-to-avoid_us_56c764eae4b041136f16d8eb

Say:
They are problems that are one of the following or a combination of two;
Mechanical
Attitudinal
Service related
Unusual

Mechanical complaints
Involve hotel equipment.
For example guestroom temperature control, hot water issues, lighting problems, plumbing, TVs, door keys, furnishings, Wi fi.
It is essential to report the complaint to the specific department like in this case maintenance or engineering or house keeping. The staff of that department should reach the guest room as quickly as possible with proper tools to rectify the problem.

Attitudinal complaints
Guest may feel they are poorly treated or not given importance some times.
Or when they overhear inappropriate staff conversations.
Employees should never argue or debate in front of the guests. If any associate has any dissonance, it should never be put across to any guest while making a conversation.

Service related complaints
Guests make service related complaints when they experience a problem with hotel service.
It can be of a wide range like long check-in check-out lines, lack of luggage assistance, food quality, room service delay, missed wake up call and so on.
Usually these situations occur when the hotel is very busy and operating on full occupancy.
It is important to be more vigilant and alert during that time.

Unusual complaints
Staff members may receive unusual complaints about circumstances over which they have no control.
These include like lack of public transportation, too much rain, too hot outside, etc.
We should listen patiently during such events and respond with appropriate guest relation techniques. We should remain friendly and sympathetic towards the guest.

Guest relations

High visibility
Easy to express their opinions
The GSA learns of potential or actual problems 
Receive attentive service 
Satisfaction of seeing their complaints resolved.

üìù Notes:
https://www.relilax.com/services/guest-relations/

Say:
Hotel employees guest service associate(GSA) and manager to handle special guest requests. Or for addressing guest grievances.
Guests may request special equipment and supplies while making a reservation, at the time of registration, or during occupancy. Like refrigerator, iron with a ironing board etc.
Despite front office efficiency and attentiveness, guests will occasionally be disappointed or find fault with something or someone in the hotel.
The high visibility of front office staff members means that they are usually the first to learn of guest complaints.
When guests find it easy to express their opinions, both the GSA and the guests benefit. The GSA learns of potential or actual problems and has the opportunity to resolve them quickly and keep guests happy; the guests receive attentive service and enjoy the satisfaction of seeing their complaints resolved.

The FOA should write in a clear handwriting the address of the passport office and give it to the guest.
Offer guest hotel cab through travel desk. The fare for the same should also be mentioned in clarity.
The directions to reach the passport office should be also explained to the guest. If possible a map can also be drawn explaining the directions and nearby locations to the guest.
While interacting the FOA should also remind the guest to carry the necessary documents and photographs for the purpose of submission.
Giving a blue or black ball pen to the guest to carry it along for filling up the documents or signing, will give a happy attention to the guest. The guest will feel important and taken care of.

Debrief:
Hotels give wake up call to groups or crews staying in the hotel. The time is usually given by the group leader or by the airline corporation office. In such cases, the person registering for wake up call informs the hotel about pick up timings for the group or crew to travel to desired location. The FOA notes the details in the wake-up call sheet and the operator gives the wake up call the specified time. The Front desk also arranges adequate staff/ bell boys to shift the luggage of the group members from their rooms to the pick up vehicle, at the time of check out.
If the breakfast is to be provided to the group, the front office department informs the kitchen and F &B service to make the necessary arrangements, and communicates the timing and venue of the breakfast to the group leader.

Travel

üìù Notes:
Say:
Travel in simple words is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short stays between the destinations.

Ask:
Now the question arises when and why did people start to choose to travel?
Elicit answers from the learners.

Say:
The answer is easily found and is just as obvious. With the process of industrialization, the life of humans changed dramatically. Working conditions changed, people moved from the country into the cities. The working class grew rapidly and a new class emerged - middle class was established. 
Gradually, the cities became overcrowded. The middle class people were hard working but also wanted to enjoy their free time in leisure as well. 

And then where could the working class humans turn to a peaceful vacation but with no patch of green can be found? 

People sought out vacations for destinations in the far away mountains and beaches. Thus the idea of the search for the better destination for holiday away from home was established.
Isn‚Äôt it interesting!!

In 1841, Thomas Cook, a businessman, made a deal with the local railways to organize the transportation of members of his community or society. Mr. Cook received a commission from the railway and effectively became the first recorded travel agent.

Now at this time aviation industry or airlines started getting popular. Hence the demand for travel agents also went up.
With the technology, the evolution of travel technology and reservation systems also improved. In 1950, Trans Canada Airlines (TCA) developed the world‚Äôs first computerized reservation system. It was called Reservations Electronically Controlled, it was commonly known as the ‚ÄòReservec.‚Äô

Say:
Travel agencies exist mainly as intermediaries or a bridge among suppliers of travel services such as carriers and hotels, and customers/guests.¬†
A travel agency is a private retailer or public service provider that provides travel and tourism related services to the public on behalf of suppliers such as activities, airlines, car rentals, cruise lines, hotels, railways, travel insurance, and package tours. In addition to dealing with ordinary tourists, most travel agencies have a separate department devoted to making travel arrangements for business travelers; some travel agencies specialize in commercial and business travel only.

üìù Notes:
Say:
A travel agent's main function is to act as a go-between, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier(Various industries in tourism).  Some examples are Cox and Kings or Thomas Cook. This is done at charge of  a percentage premium or a standard flat¬†fee or called commission.
Other commercial operations are also undertaken such as the sale of in-house insurance, travel guide books, and public transport timetables, car rentals, and the services of an on-site bureau de change, dealing in the most popular holiday currencies.
Travel Agent is a person whose job it is to arrange travel for end clients (individuals, groups, corporations) on behalf of suppliers (hotels, airlines, car rentals, cruise lines, railways, travel insurance, package tours). Their task is to simplify the travel planning process for their customers in addition to providing consultation services and entire travel packages.

A¬†travel agent¬†is the direct point of contact for a traveller who is researching and intending to purchase¬†packages and experiences through an agency. Travel agents can specialize in certain types of travel including specific destinations; outdoor adventures; and backpacking, rail, cruise, cycling, or culinary tours, to name a few. These specializations can help travellers when they require advice about their trips.

Reasons For Travel Agents

Experience 
Advocate 
Resources 
Convenience 
Value for money 
Better destinations

üìù Notes:
Ask:
Can anyone tell me why do we need travel agencies at all? We can always book directly at the hotel or on the internet? So why does the guest need to pay extra to a travel agency for the same purpose?
Engage in discussion for 10 minutes.

Say:
Travel agents have to be excellent in many skill set. They have to have the following qualities as a part of their job requirements:

Leisure Travels
Experience - Travel agents know the destinations thoroughly. The guest will be able to match a better package than they can find on the Internet.
Advocate - If something goes wrong on a guest‚Äôs trip, a good travel agent will try to get the guest‚Äôs vacation back on track.
Resources - Travel agents have access to a variety of tools that the average consumer is not able to use or doesn't know about. They can sometimes get a better seat on an airplane, added amenities at hotels, room upgrades, event tickets, and plan activities for the guest.
Convenience ‚Äì Guests time is valuable. Destinations may look good on TV or on a brochure but not actually be ideal for the guest on a personal level. Travel agents can help in matching the exact requirements of the guest as required.
Value for money - Often, travel agents can save the guest money based on their supplier relationships , while saving the guest time and effort. There are also hidden savings built into trips. A travel agent will likely book transfers for the guest, included in the price. Sometimes a package that the guests book themselves won't include those.
Better destinations -  Travel agents have inside information on the best times to go to crowded destinations and they sometimes even know what the new trending destinations are going to be before rest of the masses.

Business Travel¬†Planning and Reservations
Unlike leisure trips, which are generally planned and booked by end consumers using their choice of reservation system, business travel often involves a travel management company. Travel managers negotiate with suppliers(Airlines, hotels, rentals) and ensure that all the trip components are cost effective. 
Many business travel planners rely on¬†‚Äôglobal distribution systems (GDS)‚Äô to price and plan components. 
A global distribution system or a GDS is a computerized network system owned or operated by a company that enables transactions between travel industry service providers like airlines, hotels, car rental companies, and travel agencies. The GDS mainly uses real-time inventory (for e.g. number of hotel rooms available right now, number of flight seats available, or number of cars available) to service providers. Travel Agencies traditionally relied on GDS for services, products & rates in order to provision travel-related services to the end consumers. Thus, a (GDS) can link services, rates and bookings consolidating products and services across all three travel sectors: i.e., airline reservations, hotel reservations, car rentals.
GDS is different from a computer reservations system or CRS, which is a reservation system used by the service providers (also known as vendors). Primary customers of GDS are travel agents (both online and office-based) to make reservation on various reservation systems run by these vendors. GDS holds no inventory; the inventory is held on the vendor's reservation system itself. A GDS system will have real-time link to the vendor's database. For example, when a travel agency requests a reservation on the service of a particular airline company, the GDS system routes the request to the appropriate airline's computer reservations system and makes the reservation there.

Types of Rate

Season‚Äôs Special

Military

üìù Notes:
Say:
Travel agencies back in the day banked hard on packages and ‚Äòdeals.‚Äô Travel agents were always middlemen, but they provided a powerful economic value.

Over the years, as online booking websites have become more popular, travel agents have diminished. All those sites have made it easy for travelers to cut out the travel agent and plan guests own trips by booking directly with airlines and hotels like Airbnb, Vayable, and EatWith!. There are also so many deal websites out there helping travelers find cheap airfares and hotel rates ‚Äî and travel blogs like tripadvisor, zomato telling the guest what to see.
Travel agents still exists. That is because they still offer value for¬†certain types¬†of travel. They‚Äôre heavily used for luxury, corporate, and group travel, as well as for their expertise and special business relationships. Their time-saving, stress-relieving, and problem-solving skills cannot be compared to an online website.
Travel agents are perfect for people who just don‚Äôt want to handle a big, complicated trip themselves. For example a trip that would have multiple stops with many number of people.

So how does it benefit in terms of money?
There are various kinds of rates and deals that are offered by travel agents:
CVGR - A Company volume guaranteed rate ( CVGR) letter is offered by the Hotel to a company¬†to use the hotel services, and also to offer a special discounted rate ¬†for high volume bookings agreed by the company.
Reward programme ‚Äì Guest earns currency rewards with each booking to spend anywhere and anytime they want. Agents located many destinations are eligible to enroll in Unlimited Rewards - a loyalty program that pays the guests for each booking made through GDS websites. After a guest completes a stay with the hotel, the cash rewards are deposited onto a prepaid debit card, and can be spent anyway the guest wants.
Season special ‚Äì Low or lean  seasonal period where the crowd is not expected travel, travel agents give special discounted rates to the guest. These are custom made packages for the guest which are the best combination of money and travel. 
Military discounts - Major hotel chains frequently offer special discounts for military personnel.¬†Additionally, military personnel and their family members are eligible for discounted or complimentary admission into select recreational and theme parks, museums and galleries.

Travel Reservation System

[[OCR Image Text: Expedia |]]

[[OCR Image Text: Booking.com]]

üìù Notes:
Say:
After Canada, American Airlines, aware of the early ‚ÄòReservec‚Äô success, invested in the development of their own computerized reservation system. ¬†In partnership with IBM, they¬†developed the ‚ÄòSabre‚Äô computer reservation system. 
The increase in travel agent hotel reservations and the arrival of smaller and more powerful desktop computer systems prompted the creation of hotel reservation systems. Now, the reservation systems could be located at the hotel front desk, increasing convenience.
In 1996, a small division of Microsoft, called Expedia, launched its website offering online bookings for air, hotels, and car rentals.
Online Travel Agents (OTAs) - Increasing numbers of FITs are turning to ONLINE TRAVEL AGENTS (OTAS), companies that combine accommodations and transportation options and allow users to choose one or many components of their trip based on price or other incentives. Examples of OTAs include Booking.com, Expedia.ca, Hotwire.com, and Kayak.com.

Booking system

üìù Notes:
Ask:
Now the question is how is the booking system different when done through a travel agent or when done personally via internet, telephone, email or in person?
Engage in discussion for 10 minutes.

Say:
Unlike the other methods of reservation or the booking system, when booking through a travel agency guest pays the travel agents in advance for their complete tour¬†package¬†and the travel agent¬†guarantees¬†the client's reservation. 
In lieu, the agent provides the voucher to the¬†guests¬†indicating the required services that are required to be offered by the hotel at their destination. 
In case of no show, the hotel generally bills travel agencies for payment, and according to the agreement the travel agent must make the payment to the hotel.

How to make itinerary?

Organize the travel itinerary essentials 
Airline/ Railway tickets 
Hotel reservations 
Add in the extra activities 
Home country information 
Health information 
Leave time for exploration

üìù Notes:
Ask:
Now coming to the most interesting part of the session. We will try to make it as interactive as in reality.
Before we do that let me ask how many of you know what is an itinerary?
Elicit response form the learners. Appreciate their efforts.
Once a cumulative definition of an itinerary is generated by the learners, proceed to say.

Say:
An itinerary can be simply defined as:
A detailed plan for a journey, especially a list of places to visit; a guidebook plan of travel.
A line of travel or a route.
An account of a journey or an official record of travel.

Basis that we will have an activity. I will narrate a situation, and you all have to tell me the steps for making an itinerary. Through this activity we will understand the exact questions to ask the guest when making an itinerary.

A guest, Mrs and Mr. Sharma decides to go for a holiday to Goa for a weeks time. They are planning to go in the month of April. The have a chosen Hotel ABC in South Goa.
How can we help them to make an itinerary.
Engage in discussion for 15 minutes. Write the points suggested by the learners on a white board. Should there be any point  that you (instructor) feels should come above or below the before mentioned point, then the instructor may prompt to write correct step on the board accordingly. Reference itinerary is as below. Prompt learners to engage in a discussion.

Say:
That was a brilliant effort by each of you today. I will clearly write down the points/ steps for making an itinerary for your reference. You may note it down in your books. We always begin with a list on a paper.
Organize the travel itinerary essentials - Add the guests essential travel information to the itinerary as per order. Make a folder of a print out of a confirmation from the following:
Airline/ Railway tickets ‚Äì Passenger full names as they are listed on their passports, Airline/train name and number, Airport/ Railway station name, terminal, Date and time- arrival/departure
Hotel reservations ‚Äì Address, contact number, Confirmed reservation number, Check in/ check out time, dates of stay, meal plan.
Advance amount paid for tickets ahead of time and any receipts or confirmations received
Name of travel agent / booking agent / website source of¬†booking (i.e. expedia.com, hotels.com, etc)
Rental car confirmations ‚Äì Airport assistance, Local transport for sight seeing and other places to visit 
Restaurant reservations ‚Äì If any for special occasion.
Add in the extra activities ‚Äì Add all the details for suitable activities that Mrs and Mr. Sharma would want to  pursue on their vacation. Such as finding tours, sightseeing adventures, shows, excursions. Also note tour company name (and name of guide if you have it ahead of time), Tour dates & times, Tour meeting and ending point.
Home country information - This information is the type one would not anticipate to use, but if needed it, it's going to save a lot of time to have it handy. Travel itinerary should include: 
The address of home country's¬†local embassy, state department headquarters or consulate address and phone numbers. List the information for each country, if the guest is travelling to more than one.
Health information - Names, addresses and phone number of local hospital in each area the guest will be traveling. A brief medical history of traveling companions written down in that country's language if possible.
Leave time for exploration ‚Äì There should be room for flexibility. If on a planner certain sightseeing place is decided for a particular day, but due to some reason the guest is unable to visit that place on that day, there should be provision for going the same place on some other day. Some extra days should be left free in the itinerary as sometimes that guest might get a recommendation from a local that could be a must visit but not planned before.

Questions to ask

Have you checked  flights? 
Which location?
How many nights do you plan to stay?
How soon are you travelling?
Where do you want to go?
Are you a city person or do you want to avoid the hustle & bustle?
Planes, trains & automobiles?
What do you expect from your hotels?
What special extras?

üìù Notes:
Say:
We understood so far the details of an itinerary. Now we will see the ‚ÄòRIGHT‚Äô questions to ask the guest when approached at a travel desk. 
Have you checked & priced your international flights? 
Flights are a big part of any travel budget and their cost can have a significant impact on a guest‚Äôs budget for their land arrangements. 
Where will you fly into &¬†out of the chosen destination?
Many countries and states have more than one airport. It is better to understand the convenient location preferred by the guest.
How many nights do you plan to stay in the chosen destination?
This is very important as it will allow the travel agent to judge how many places realistically the guest can visit on their trip while still keeping the pace relaxed.¬†
How soon are you travelling?
To know the expected arrival/departure date of the guest gives an idea about whether the visit is in high season or low season. This allows the travel agency time to make and confirm all arrangements, process payments, prepare &¬†send a personalized documentation pack including road and city maps (with all hotels and meeting points marked), itineraries, tourist brochures & information, restaurant suggestions, etc. ¬†This way, the guests have plenty of time to acquaint themselves with the locations they will be visiting and can ask the agent any final questions or seek clarification well before they pack their bags.
Where do you want to go in the chosen destination?
This question is for the guest to have for an overview of the regions (key sights, history, geography, cuisine, festivals, and more).¬†
What do you want to experience in the chosen destination?
Guests should be politely asked about their hobbies and interests and also their occupation.¬†This gives an idea about the guests likes and dislikes. Hence an itinerary can be prepared keeping the interest of the guest in mind. For example musical shows, stand up comedy, local cuisine, shopping etc.
Are you a city person or do you want to avoid the hustle & bustle?
The guest should be asked if they would want to include any small villages and towns in their itinerary? This can not only influence the types of places they stay but also how they travel around. For example if the guests want to avoid the big cities, then they may wish to take a self-drive tour of a few regions staying at some charming historic hotels. 
Is being on the beach or near the coast a key part of this trip?
Planes, trains & automobiles ‚Äì any preferences?
Travel agencies take care of all the travel logistics and will¬†book car-hire, high speed train tickets, airport transfers, buses and private drivers for the guests. Knowing guest‚Äôs preferences in advance allows the travel agents to help make the most of their trip. For example, if the guests prefer to fly than take a high-speed train or vice versa.
What do you expect from your hotels in chosen destination?
Big, small, historical, modern, traditional in style or more contemporary? What style suits the travelling party? What is the guest‚Äôs hotel budget per night?¬†It is an important factor to decide the price of the compete package. Whether and if a guest is interested in staying 5 star super luxury hotel or prefers an Air BNB. 
This can include special dietary requirements, concierge, porter-age, pool, gym, entertainment and any other facilities the guest might think must have on-site.
What special extras can we factor in for you?
This question to gain information such as whether the guests need private tour guides, pre-booked tickets to popular museums and monuments, private transfers, ¬†and other expenses that will meet their budget. If their budget is limited, travel agents may not, for example, include private guides but instead, group city tours which cost less.
If there is any special occasion like marriage anniversary or birthday that falls during the trip.

üìù Notes:
Ask:
What do you see in this picture?
Elicit learners to answer.

Say:
Picture number 1 is a an Indian Visa. Carefully observe that is an entry date, expiry date, entry points, and endorsement that says that ‚Äòstay during each visit should not excess 180 days.‚Äô 
Picture number 2 is a template for Indian Passport. It has passport number, expiry date and other personal details of the holder.

Now I have a question to ask.
Ask:
Will any Indian passport holder need an Indian Visa to visit any state in India?
Engage in discussion for 10 minutes.

Say:
It was a trick question. If any person has an Indian passport that means he/she is a citizen of India. Hence they would not need Indian Visa to reside or visit in any state of our country.

üìù Notes:
Instructions:
Before summarising, ask the learners to give one point each that they remember from today‚Äôs class.
Spend about 10 minutes in collating points from the learners.
¬†
Say:
I would like you to recall the points that you learnt today.
¬†
Note: Ask the learners to volunteer to share a point. Else, choose the learners who did not participate much in the discussions for recalling a point.
¬†
Say: 
Thank you for participating actively. I will now summarise the session. Using a Travel Agent is beneficial for customers who plan multi-destination and/ or international trips. Booking through an agent saves time and ‚Äòheadaches‚Äô. The experience and consultancy comes from 'one hand' - the agent who combines all the travel components and services for the guest/ traveler. Often agents also dispose of unpublished deals and activities which is beneficial for the traveler. To sum up the session we could say:
Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations, that can be done by various method of transportation.
With the development of aviation industry or airlines the demand for travel agents also went up.
In 1950, Trans Canada Airlines (TCA) developed the world‚Äôs first computerized reservation system, called Reservations Electronically Controlled, or the ‚ÄòReservec.‚Äô
Travel agencies exist mainly as intermediaries among suppliers of travel services such as carriers and hotels, and customers/guests.¬†
A travel agent's act as a go-between, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier(Various industries in tourism). 
A Company volume guaranteed rate ( CVGR) is offered by the Hotel to a company¬†to use the hotel services, and also to offer a special discounted rate ¬†for high volume bookings agreed by the company.
Guest pays the travel agents in advance for their complete tour¬†package¬†and the travel agent¬†guarantees¬†confirmed reservation. 
An itinerary is a detailed plan for a journey, especially a list of places to visit; a guidebook plan of travel.
A travel visa is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter, remain within, or to leave that country., for a pre determined period of time.
Immigration check is conducted for all passengers, Indians or foreigners, both at the time of arrival and departure.

This brings to the end of our today‚Äôs session. Hope you had a good time today. Until next time. Good bye.
